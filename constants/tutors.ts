I'd love to help you find the strategies and schedule that work best for you to reach your goal score. I also offer advice on med school applications, including personal statements, secondaries, interview prep, and general questions. In my free time, I enjoy Arcane, Attack on Titan, Fortnite, and Maplestory.";

      return "I'm Saanvi. My MCAT journey was a bit unconventional and a little embarassing: I actually scored a 492 on my first exam. Eventually, I worked hard to earn a 516 but I learned A LOT about what you should and shouldn't do. I really like working with non-trad students since I emphathize with the struggles you face. Recently, I graduated NYU and work as a Clinic Research Coordinator at Einstein.";

My academic background spans the full pre-med curriculum, including inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics, along with extensive coursework in earth sciences and evolutionary biology. I self-studied for the MCAT over one semester, achieving a score of 526 with perfect scores in three out of four sections (132 CP / 130 CARS / 132 BB / 132 PS). I bring over five years of tutoring experience across a wide range of subjects, from 1st to 12th-grade Math, Science, and English to ACT and SAT preparation. Tutoring is a true passion of mineâ€”I love helping students master concepts that once felt out of reach.";
