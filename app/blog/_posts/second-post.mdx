## S-Tier
**AAMC**
The AAMC is obviously goated, especially their section bank materials, FLs, and CARs question pack, but they do have some flaws. Namely, the earlier exams look nothing like recent exams. Still, it's the source.

## A-Tier
**Anki • UWorld • MyMCAT**
Listen, I'll be the first to say it: I hate Anki, I never liked Anki, I built a dope website because I hate Anki. That being said, it's undeniable that the students who can stomach it used it to learn content and did a banging job. Same with UWorld. Yes, it goes way too far into the details, and often has some passages that I can only describe as BS, but it's a very good QBank. As for MyMCAT, it's the only adaptive MCAT software in the market and lightyears ahead of anything else tech wise. Plus, their inventor is really good looking.

## B-Tier
**Khan Academy • AK Lectures • Blueprint FLs • Altius FLs • ExamKrackers**
Khan Academy and AK Lectures are great content, but that's all they are: content. Blueprint FLs and Altius FLs are hard but good, although not really representative of AAMC. ExamKrackers have great discretes in their 1001 questions series, but I think they've recently discontinued them.

## C-Tier
**Jack Westin • Kaplan Books**
Jack Westin is free, but that doesn't mean it's good. It's alright at best, terrible at worst. Kaplan Books range from decent to someone hitting you in the head with random bolded words and facts. Very inefficient method of studying and, eventually, it becomes nothing more than a paper weight.

## D-Tier
**Test-Prep Company Courses**
Do not pay $1000-$5000 for a course when you can find all that information for free online. It's like purchasing an OnlyFans versus going to the numerous free offerings online: you're paying money to be a sucker. Don't be a sucker.
