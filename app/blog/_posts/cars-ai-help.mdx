Kalypso is your AI study partner for CARS, designed to help both during testing and review. Let's explore how to use him effectively:

# During Testing

Kalypso can be activated in several ways:
- Press `Cmd + A` (or `Ctrl + A` on Windows)
- Click the cat icon in the top right
- It automatically activates after:
  - 7 minutes on a passage
  - 3 minutes on a question

# When Stuck on a Passage

1. Ask for a summary of the entire passage
2. Request paragraph-by-paragraph breakdowns
3. Copy/paste confusing sentences for explanation
4. Use `Cmd + I` for quick word definitions

Here's a demonstration:

# During Review

The review process is crucial for improvement. Here's how to use Kalypso effectively:

1. Start with tooltips/explanations turned OFF
2. Try to explain the answer yourself first
3. Discuss with Kalypso:
   - Why the correct answer is right
   - Why your answer was wrong
   - What pattern you might have missed
4. Use hint/relevant context features
5. Finally, turn on tooltips and compare with official explanations

Here's how it looks in practice:
