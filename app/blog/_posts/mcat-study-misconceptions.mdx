## Complete Everything And Then You Will Be Ready

That is an ungodly amount of work. Let's say you use the Anki decks of MilesDown, Aiden, JackSparrow, or whatever else is popular when you start: that's between 4000-7000 cards. And with UWorld, they have nearly 3000+ questions. Kaplan has 7 books. There is far too much stuff to learn, and plenty of students study for a month and end up scoring 520+ whereas some of you have studied for years to score a 505. 

Because the MCAT is not a test of memorization, but rather a test of your ability to apply your knowledge to novel situations. It's not about how much you know, but how well you can apply your knowledge to new situations. It's like you're fighting a dude three times your size, who's also a ninja, and thinking that if you let him keep hitting you in the face you'll learn to beat him eventually.

Nah, he's gonna kick your ass. The truth is, you need to study him: learn from his moves, his patterns, your mistakes, and adapt your strategy. Which means that if you only completed half of Anki, UWorld, and Kaplan, but instead spent that time really reviewing your practice exams and thinking through the test logically, you'd do better.

After all, the test is not a measure of how much you can cram into your brain. It's more a measure of how well you can apply the information you have to new situations.

## The "Save AAMC Materials" Mistake

Saving all your AAMC materials for the final few weeks is one of the most common - and costly - mistakes I see students make. Fly blind for months and discover what you suck at right before your test.

Our approach at MyMCAT.ai is straightforward: start with the unscored AAMC sample test to get an early baseline. Then, when you're about seventy days out from test day, begin taking the scored practice tests, spacing them evenly throughout your remaining prep time with content learning and practice.

We weave AAMC materials throughout your study plan - not right at the start, but not all at the end either. This balanced approach lets you use these materials diagnostically, identifying and targeting your weak spots months before test day, not just weeks. 

This way, instead of getting blindsided by a 500 with only four weeks to go, you'll know where you stand months in advance. And more importantly, you'll have the time and guidance to actually do something about it.

## Anki Is God

Personally, I think Anki sucks. It's beneficial because it's spaced repetition, and that's a scientifically proven method for learning. However, the problem is that it's too easy to overdo it. You can easily spend 2 hours a day on Anki, but that's 2 hours where you're not doing something else. And if you're not careful, you can end up mindlessly doing Anki for hours without really thinking or processing anything.

Also it's boring, which is why [MyMCAT](https://mymcat.ai) turned it into a game.

## The "More Hours = Better Score" Fallacy

Many students believe that studying longer hours automatically leads to better scores. **But two hours of locking in beats six hours of mindlessly hitting flashcards or passively reading a content review book.** We advise 2-4 hours of focused study per day, for nontraditional students, and 4-6 hours for traditional students. You are a human being, which means you need to eat, sleep, have a social life, and take care of your other needs. If the MCAT consumes every waking moment of your life, then you're not doing yourself any favors.


## The "Practice Tests = Progress" Error

While practice tests are crucial, many students mistake taking multiple full-length exams for actual progress. Without proper review and analysis, taking tests becomes a passive exercise that doesn't lead to improvement.

## The "Save AAMC Materials" Mistake

Many students save all AAMC materials for the last few weeks of preparation. While these resources are valuable, integrating them throughout your preparation helps you better understand the exam's style and expectations.

## The Memorization Over Understanding Approach

Too many students focus on memorizing facts rather than understanding concepts. The MCAT tests your ability to apply knowledge to novel situations, making pure memorization an ineffective strategy.

## The Right Way Forward

Instead of falling for these misconceptions, here's how we solve each one:

1. **Consistent, Integrated Learning**
   - Our system interweaves content review with practice from day one
   - Every question you solve (whether on MyMCAT, UWorld, or AAMC) builds your knowledge profile
   - No more arbitrary "content phase" followed by "practice phase"

2. **Quality Over Quantity, Tracked**
   - We recommend 2-4 hours for nontraditional and 4-6 hours for traditional students
   - Our coin system rewards consistent, focused study over marathon sessions
   - Built-in breaks and pacing to prevent burnout

3. **Strategic AAMC Usage**
   - Start with the unscored AAMC sample test for baseline
   - Space remaining AAMC materials throughout your ~70-day countdown
   - Use results diagnostically to target weaknesses months ahead

4. **Active Learning Over Memorization**
   - Transformed Anki into an interactive clinic game
   - Patient-based scenarios replace passive flashcards
   - Multiple learning modalities: videos, readings, and practice problems

5. **Data-Driven Progress Tracking**
   - Granular tracking of Knowledge Categories (KCs) and Concept Categories (CCs)
   - Real-time weakness identification
   - Adaptive content delivery based on your performance

Remember, successful MCAT preparation isn't about following popular myths or grinding mindlessly. It's about consistent, strategic practice with real-time feedback and adaptation. That's why we've built [MyMCAT](https://www.mymcat.ai) to guide you through this process systematically.
