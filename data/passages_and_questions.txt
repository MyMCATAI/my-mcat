Passage: 
Over the fall of 2010, rapper Kanye West reimagined the way music was distributed by engaging in an online conversation with millions. For most of that year, Kanye West was firmly present on the cultural radar. This was deliberate and made his presence, performances, and music an ongoing conversation with his fans, his past, and a larger network of engaged online participants. By demonstrating the affordances of participatory culture, West presents a framework for engagement and communication that critical educators can leverage even within the increasingly restrictive space of public education.
Though the capitalist practices that led to his album spending more than six months on the Billboard 200 may not seem like the obvious place to search for liberatory educational pedagogy, I argue that the strategies developed and tested by West offer an important framework for guiding critical consciousness and fomenting action within our classrooms.
As a Hip Hop fan and former music journalist, I often infused my classroom with beats and rhymes. Whether it was the first Lupe Fiasco album encouraging my students to consider the blend between Hip Hop and skateboarder social groups on my campus or formally utilizing classics like Grandmaster Flash’s “The Message” and Dead Prez’s “Police State” as starting points for literary and critical analysis, Hip Hop played a formative part in my teaching practice. For the eight years that I spent teaching English and ELL courses at a public school in South Central Los Angeles, my classroom breathed Hip Hop as well as music across genres to speak to the diverse youth population I worked with. Approximately 80% of my students identified as Latino and 19% as Black, and the school had a dropout rate that rocketed above 60%. Despite being characterized in the media by stereotypes of a failing school, my students exuded a passion to learn that showed me optimism in transforming schools.
Throughout this teaching time, I can see now how Kanye West’s music acted as a through line in my classroom. On a year-round schedule, my first year teaching allowed me to bring in West’s infamous 2005 declaration that “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people” during a Hurricane Katrina relief telethon. Meanwhile, West’s singles filtered into my classroom as music played by students or analyzed for various writing assignments. At the time that West revolutionized media distribution and opportunities for pedagogical growth in 2010, I was working with ninth-grade students and exploring how mobile devices like iPods could help connect urban youth with civically engaging movements beyond the classroom.
Just in time to be critically heralded by music publications ranging from XXL to Rolling Stone, Kanye West's fifth solo album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, was released in the United States on November 22, 2010. However, even by the time the album leaked through file-sharing networks and torrents online, weeks before the official release date, its music was anything but surprising. Via his own music label, G.O.O.D. (Getting Out Our Dreams), West leaked many of the tracks from his album as free downloads during the fall. A matter of a few clicks from his official website yielded more than snippets from the album. Releasing one song each week on “G.O.O.D. Fridays” and responding to challenges and criticism from fans via Twitter, West sustained interest and anticipation throughout the world. In addition to a slew of tracks from the album, including the lead single "Power," West released numerous tracks that were subsequently never officially included in the final album. Speculation about what would make the cut drove buzz around My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy rather than speculation about what kind of sound the album would take. By the end of 2010, West had given away fifteen different tracks, including two of the lead singles from his album: a remix of “Power” and the cameo-filled “Monster.” Through the use of simple and public media tools like Twitter, West moved popular hip-hop models of marketing beyond traditional mixtape culture and illustrated how participatory culture can help foment profit as well as awareness and social organization.

Title: Machine Learning - 2
Description: "Buckle up, folks! We're about to dive into a thrilling rollercoaster ride through the world of AI prediction with a passage titled Machine Learning. It’s a little more challenging than usual, but a good read if you’re interested in machines (P.S. I prefer to be called a ai-powered superkitty, NOT a machine. It’s like if I called you a little flesh bag. Not nice, is it?)”

Passage:
Machine learning does not represent an increase in artificial general intelligence that could substitute machines for all aspects of human cognition but rather focuses on one particular aspect of intelligence: prediction. Prediction, in the statistical sense, uses existing data to fill in missing information. As deep-learning pioneer Geoffrey Hinton said, “Take any old problem where you have to predict something and you have a lot of data, and deep learning is probably going to make it work better than the existing techniques.”
Prediction is useful because it is an input into decision-making. Each prediction task is a perfect complement to a decision task, specifying the confidence of a probability associated with an outcome under conditions of uncertainty. Effective decision-making also requires data collection, organization, action based on the decision, and the judgment to evaluate the payoffs associated with different outcomes.
We examine four direct effects through which advances in prediction technology may affect labor in a task-based framework:
1. Substituting capital for labor in prediction tasks.
2. Automating decision tasks when automating prediction increases the relative returns to capital versus labor.
3. Enhancing labor when automating the prediction task increases labor productivity in related decision tasks.
4. Creating new decision tasks when automating prediction sufficiently reduces uncertainty to enable new decisions.
First, artificial intelligence may directly substitute capital for labor in prediction tasks. Some tasks, like demand forecasting, are already prediction tasks. Where humans currently perform these tasks, they are increasingly replaced by artificial intelligence. Other tasks not historically viewed as prediction tasks are being transformed into prediction-oriented tasks as machine learning improves and the quality-adjusted cost of prediction decreases. For example, recruiting in human resources involves predicting which applicants will perform best in the job based on resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and interview transcripts.
Second, when automated prediction can increase the relative returns to capital versus labor in complementary decision tasks, it can lead to the complete automation of a complementary decision task. For instance, machine reaction times are faster than human reaction times. The returns to a machine predicting a potential car accident a few seconds before a human would predict it are higher when the response time of the machine is faster. Thus, automating the prediction task increases the returns to automating certain decision tasks associated with vehicle control.
Third, automating the prediction task may increase the productivity of labor in some cases. For example, ODS Medical developed a device that uses artificial intelligence to predict whether an area of brain tissue has cancer cells during surgery. This enables surgeons to make more precise decisions, reducing the removal of noncancerous tissue and ensuring all cancerous tissue is removed. The device augments the labor of brain surgeons, allowing them to make more nuanced and improved choices.
The fourth type of direct impact of artificial intelligence on labor happens when automated prediction sufficiently reduces uncertainty to enable new decision tasks that did not exist before. Depending on the relative costs of labor and capital, these new tasks can be performed by either. Some tasks that are not economically viable when uncertainty is high become viable as prediction technology reduces uncertainty. This aligns with the reinstatement force, where automation increases the returns to technologies that use labor for new tasks.
The interaction of these four forces determines the net direct effect of cheaper quality-adjusted predictions on labor demand. There are also indirect effects: as some tasks become more efficient, demand for upstream and downstream tasks might change. For example, automating translation on an online trading platform enhances international trade, affecting the labor involved upstream and downstream on both sides of the trade.

Title: An Incredibly Difficult Passage On…Furries? - 3
Description: “Hold onto your tails! "An Incredibly Difficult Passage On...Furries?" takes us on a mind-bending romp through the world of Otherkin identities. It’s one of the hardest passages we have, and reads like a catnip-induced fever dream. This is what you signed up for though, babes.” 
Citation: Johnston, Jay. “On Having a Furry Soul: Transpecies Identity and Ontological Indeterminacy in Otherkin Subcultures.” In Animal Death, edited by Jay Johnston and Fiona Probyn-Rapsey, 293–306. Sydney University Press, 2013. https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt1gxxpvf.23.
Passage:
Paradoxically, while challenging the boundaries of the human, Otherkin identities simultaneously desire to maintain the definitions and borders given to animal and human in dominant discourse: otherwise, the construction of their own difference (from the ‘norm’) disperses. Can such a proposition of human–animal identity be proposed in a way in which radical difference is not elided? Would this require the death of both the ‘human’ and the ‘animal’? Such a death would seem a constructive creation. That is, a proposal of Transpecies identity where ‘Other’ ceases to be the operative word: for it is always ‘other to what?’ Such politics are notoriously difficult, and perhaps it is enough that animal–human subcultures push at the boundaries of the human, of normative subjectivity.
Central to this ‘pushing’ for Otherkin are concepts of spirit and soul. This accords a reanimation of spirituality in the public sphere that knits together religion, art and media creations and personal experience that questions both the role of the animal in religion and the individual relation to an eclectic world. Such developments require rethinking both the personal and political role of contemporary religious belief. Accompanying this are questions as to what type of metaphysical and/or ontological ‘grounds’ these subjectivities are built upon. Discourses of presence–absence would seem to sit uneasily underneath such heterodox selves.
And then there is the issue of the singular: surely the ethical endeavor requires seeing/meeting the individual, not the ‘animal’ universal, generic or plural. This link of looking and alterity is made apparent in Haraway’s discussion of the etymology and definition of the term species: “Rooted in specere, ‘to look’ and ‘to behold’, species takes us to the image impressed on a wax tablet. To the idea impressed on a receptive mind, and to the sovereign stamped on metal coins. Referring both to the relentlessly specific or particular and to a class of individuals with the same characteristics, species contains its own opposite in the most promising – or special – way. Species means radical difference as well as logical, classificatory kind. (2008, xxiii)”
Both meeting species and/or understanding one’s identity as Transpecies or as Otherkin do therefore require a certain vision, a response-ability and a continual questioning: How does one enter into ethical relations with the animal-other: that one is and yet is not? For what does this gaze call? In answer, Derrida proposed: “As with every bottomless gaze, as with the eyes of the other, the gaze called ‘animal’ offers to my sight the abyssal limit of the human: the inhuman or the ahuman. (2008, 12)”
Here is a productive recognition of limit – this limit is also potentiality. This is simultaneously the death of the animal and the death of the human as well as their re-birth as an elusive limit. Although it has been noted herein that Therianthrope subjectivity can be read as employing a universal concept of the animal that does not ethically take into account radical difference (an alterity not premised upon the human or dimorphic concepts of gender), it is equally evident that the questioning of the human and of normative identity categories that the subculture embraces is valuable. It is a more complex, creative and respectful approach to subject identity than that which is currently found in normative anthropocentric discourses of the human. To consider oneself inherently and ontologically betwixt and between species is perhaps not so much pathological as political.
At first glance, Otherkin may seem a faddish, perhaps even quaint or fashionable subculture. However, rather than simply dismiss or ridicule the subcultures, what is argued herein is that these individuals' relationships and their critique of the human can offer potentially useful renegotiations of the concept of subjectivity and how relations with radical difference (alterity) are lived. These negotiations are underlined by the productive death of both the animal and the human.
Questions:
Based on the passage, the author suggests that the concept of Otherkin identities challenges dominant discourses about human and animal boundaries by: (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. Emphasizing the need to abolish all distinctions between human and animal. 
2. Advocating for the maintenance of traditional definitions to preserve identity. 
3. Merging our understandings of humanity and animal nature.
4. Proposing new forms of identity that transcend traditional human-animal distinctions.[z][aa] (Correct)

2. Otherkin identities are fundamentally human constructs.
3. Otherkin identities redefine the scientific definition of animal.
4. The differences between humans and animals are only social.

1. The convention would focus exclusively on accurate animal costume design.
2. Attendees would engage in debates about the viability of human-animal hybrids.
3. The event would incorporate spirituality and alternative forms of subjectivity. (Correct)
4. The convention would ban all references to human characteristics or identities.
Title: Sporus - 1
Description:  “Ummmmm…Nero was lowkey kinda messed up? This is a little more disturbing than your average historical romance (okay, a lot!) and delves into theories of lust, power, and political machinations in the imperial court. It’s an easy and interesting read :).”
Citation: Dean, Zoie. ( 2023) "Rome & Her Greatest Theatric: The Controversies of Emperor Nero," Tenor of Our Times: Vol. 12, Article 15.


Passage:
Suetonius introduced Sporus by stating simply: “He tried to turn the slave boy Sporus into a woman by cutting off his testicles, and he had conducted to him before many witnesses as his wife in a proper ceremony with dowry and a red veil.” Nero met and married Sporus while on his trip to Greece sometime between 66 and 67 AD. Dio claimed that Nero’s reasoning for marrying Sporus was his likeness to Poppaea Sabina, whom he began to miss dearly after he killed her. Nero forced him to wear the jewelry and clothing of an imperial woman, and engaged in open, uncomfortable, public displays of affection with Sporus. The nature of this relationship is traditionally thought to be fueled by lust and sexual violence, in accordance with the pattern Nero displayed with his other sexual partners; however, a recent theory has offered a different interpretation.
David Woods provided this new interpretation in his 2009 article Nero and Sporus, where he suggested that Nero and Sporus’ relationship was not about lust, but rather Nero humiliating an opponent to the throne. Woods suggested that Sporus’ appearance being similar to Poppaea would be interpreted by Nero as Sporus being a descendent of Poppaea; therefore, Sporus may have had imperialistic ties. Woods asserted that this explained Nero’s decision to have Sporus castrated and turned into a woman—to humiliate and prevent him from ascending to Emperor. Woods attempted to back his claim by providing three key pieces of evidence. The first is that Nero had previously used sexual violence as a way to assert his dominance over those he felt threatened by. Woods found that the two best examples of this are when Nero sexually assaulted both Britannicus and Aulus Plautus before he murdered them. Woods explained that he let Sporus live longer to prolong humiliation and because Sporus ultimately was not as big of a threat as the other two had been to his throne. He argued that Nero likely had plans to kill Sporus eventually.
Woods’ second argument was that Nero had Sporus castrated; Woods claimed that this proved Nero was concerned about Sporus’ lineage and wanted to prevent Sporus from having heirs. Woods’ third piece of evidence was that Nero’s successors desired to keep Sporus for themselves, despite not being perceived to desire him sexually. Woods said this proved Sporus’ lineage, as Nero’s successors merely wanted to keep an eye on him. Woods concluded that the nature of this relationship between Nero and Sporus was undeniably riddled with sexual violence and humiliation, but at its core, this relationship was much less about lust than historians originally thought: “In conclusion, the marriage of Nero and Sporus had nothing to do with love…It had been intended simply to humiliate a potential rival for the throne through the use of sexual violence against him.”
In 2014 Michael Charles reviewed Woods’ work in an article titled “Nero and Sporus Again”, where he described Woods’ theory as “entirely novel”. Charles stated that Woods’ theory rests too much on extreme speculation and slowly unraveled each of Woods’ key three arguments. Charles began by pointing out that Sporus had been a slave, and no matter how much he resembled Poppaea, Nero would not have been threatened in any way by his lineage. Woods’ theory was heavily flawed in its contention that Nero would not have just killed Sporus if he was a threat to his throne; Charles explained that what we know of Nero’s behavior gave the opposite of that impression. He further explained that if there was genuine concern about Sporus’ lineage, at the very least, Nero’s successors would have had him killed. For Woods’ theory to work regarding Nero’s successors, Sporus’ potential lineage would have been common knowledge, and yet, there was no mention of it by the ancient writers. Woods failed to consider what the ancient authors did report; specifically, Dio’s claim that Nero had Sporus castrated in an attempt to turn him into a woman because he simply missed Poppaea. Charles concluded that due to the uncertainties at the very core of Woods’ theory, it can be given no credibility.

Based on the passage, which of the following motivations attributed to Nero's treatment of Sporus is LEAST supported by either the traditional view or Woods' theory? (Reasoning Within the Text,1)
1. A desire to publicly degrade a potential rival for political gain.
2. An attempt to replicate his deceased wife Poppaea in physical form.
3. A calculated effort to prevent the continuation of a potentially threatening lineage.
4. A compulsion driven by cruelty independent of political or emotional motivations. (Correct)


Title: Project 2025 - 2
Description: “‘Project 2025’ presents a provocative vision of presidential authority that's about as subtle as a bull in a china shop. It's a little more controversial than your average civics lesson. As a cat, I don’t have many political opinions. But I do NOT like autocrats! Say no to Fidel Catstro and Meowsollini!”
Citation: Vought, Russ.“Executive Office of the United States.” In Project 2025, edited by Paul Dans and Steven Groves, 43-44. 2024.
Passage:
In its opening words, Article II of the U.S. Constitution makes it clear that “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” That enormous power is not vested in departments or agencies, in staff for administrative bodies, in nongovernmental organizations, or other entities close to the government. The President must set and enforce a plan for the executive branch. However, a President today often assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy carrying out its own policy plans and preferences—or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly “woke” faction of the country.
The modern conservative President’s task is to limit, control, and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people. This challenge is exacerbated by factors such as Congress’s tendency to delegate its lawmaking power to agency bureaucracies, the notion of expert “independence” that protects so-called expert authorities from scrutiny, the difficulty in holding career civil servants accountable for their performance, and the increasing power and weaponization of many agencies against the public and the President.
In Federalist No. 47, James Madison warned that “[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” Regrettably, this describes the modern executive branch, which—whether controlled by the bureaucracy or by the President—writes federal policy, enforces that policy, and often adjudicates whether that policy was properly drafted and enforced. The situation is constitutionally dire, unsustainably expensive, and urgently needs repair. The survival of self-governance in America is at stake.
The great challenge for a conservative President is the need to aggressively use the executive branch's vast powers to return power to the American people. This requires a combination of boldness and self-denial: boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will and self-denial to use the bureaucratic machine to send power away from Washington and back to America’s families, faith communities, local governments, and states.
Fortunately, a President willing to lead will find in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) the necessary levers to reverse this trend and impose a sound direction on the federal bureaucracy. The effectiveness of these EOP levers depends on the premise that it is the President’s agenda that should guide the departments and agencies operating under his constitutional authority. It is generally the President’s chosen advisers who best understand the President’s aims and intentions, both regarding the policies he intends to enact and the interests that must be secured to govern successfully on behalf of the American people.


Questions:
Why did the author's reference James Madison's warning in Federalist No. 47? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. To argue for power to be returned to the states. 
2. To advocate for power to be taken away from the President. 
3. To criticize the current state of the executive branch. (Correct)
4. To challenge the idea of hereditary leadership.


Which of the following best summarizes the central argument of the passage? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. The President should relinquish control over federal agencies to allow for more efficient governance.
2. The executive branch has unconstitutionally accumulated power, necessitating presidential action to restore the balance of power and local autonomy. (Correct)
3. Conservative presidents face unique challenges in implementing their agendas due to bureaucratic resistance.
4. The expansion of presidential power is necessary to counteract the influence of radical factions within the government.


According to the passage, which of the following statements would the author mostly likely agree with? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. The president should use the powers of the executive branch to center power on the White House rather than federal agencies 
2. It is justified to use levers to replace the members of these federal agencies with ones that act in accordance with the president’s will[as].
3. Churches, mosques, and synagogues would become more powerful in a less centralized government[at].


1. I and II
2. I only
3. II and III[au][av] (Correct)
4. II only 


If research showed that federal agencies were more effective at implementing policies than state or local governments, how might this affect the author's argument? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. It would strengthen his position on presidential power. 
2. It would weaken his constitutional arguments for decentralization. 
3. It would have no effect on his constitutional arguments. (Correct) 
4. It would support the author's critique of the bureaucracy.
The author calls for the president to “bend and break the bureaucracy to the presidential will” (paragraph 4) which: (Reasoning Within the Text, 1)
1. demonstrates an example of the president “return[ing] power to the American people.”
2. embodies the self-denial that will galvanize local governments.
3. contradicts with the implied goals of “send[ing] power away from Washington.”[aw][ax][ay]  (Correct)
4. agrees well with James Madison’s warnings in the Federalist papers.


In paragraph 4, the author's call for "boldness" and "self-denial" suggests that the ideal conservative President should: (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. Empower other branches of government over the presidency.
2. Completely dismantle the federal bureaucracy and centralize power. 
3. Assert control over agencies while ultimately reducing central authority. (Correct)
4. Defer all decision-making to local governments and agencies.
The author’s tone can be best described as: (Foundations of Comprehension)
1. vengeful and sarcastic.
2. urgent and serious.[az][ba] (Correct)
3. analytical and understanding[bb][bc].
4. forceful and conservative.[bd][be]
Suppose that Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, censored the press and arrested dissenters during the Civil War. How would the author likely feel about these actions? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. Appreciative of the aggressive use of the executive branch’s powers.
2. Skeptical unless it was done in service of the American people[bf][bg]. (Correct)
3. Abhorred at the lack of presidential self-denial.
4. Indifferent to the violations of civil liberties.
Which of the following statements, if true, would most weaken the claims about the “woke” faction mentioned in paragraph 1? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,3)
1. Few of its members hold positions in bureaucratic agencies.
2. Some of their members have defected to conservatism.
3. Most members protest the policies set by federal bureaucracies.
4. Bureaucracies that enact “woke” preferences are unpopular.[bh][bi] (Correct)

1. Historical examples of presidents successfully limiting bureaucratic power and returning authority to local governments. (Correct)
2. A detailed explanation of the constitutional clauses that support expanded presidential authority.
3. Statistics showing increased public dissatisfaction with the decisions of the executive branch.
4. A comparison of policy outcomes between presidentially-directed agencies and more independent ones.




Title: Pitchfork’s Review on Peppa’s Adventures: The Album - 2 
Description: “Peppa Pig owes me money so I don’t have many NICE things to say about her, but this is a very fun read and a passage that’s the right level of challenging.”


Citation: Thomas, Peyton. "Peppa's Adventures: The Album, Peppa Pig." Pitchfork, July 31, 2021. https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peppa-pig-peppas-adventures-the-album/.


Passage:
Peppa’s Adventures: The Album, the second LP by UK singer-songwriter and television star Peppa Pig, arrives at a critical moment for the young artist. Only 4 years old, and one of very few pigs working in the music industry today, Peppa’s rise has been as rapid as it was unlikely. Her 2019 debut, My First Album, was an unexpected smash upon release. The record racked up 136 million streams, reached No. 1 on the UK Independent Albums Breakers chart, and won accolades from fellow pop renegades Charli XCX and Lil Nas X. As Peppa readied her sophomore effort, critics wondered: Was My First Album a fluke? Or is Peppa equipped to play in the UK’s crowded pop big leagues, alongside more established stars like Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran?
On My First Album, Peppa made a careful study of Brian Wilson’s sunny melodies and progressive pop structure. She hews closely to this formula throughout Peppa’s Adventures, particularly on the wistful “Perfect Day” and on “Recycling,” which evokes Fiona Apple in its percussive use of glass bottles and tin cans. Reaching further into pop’s past, she interpolates British and American folk music on the cheery “The School Bus Song” and the contemplative “Winter Days.” The traditionalist approach to production pairs well with Peppa’s efficient songwriting. She’s adept at mining the mundane stuff of suburban life for glittering moments of camaraderie. “Perfect Day” celebrates the simple pleasures of friendship, particularly poignant after more than a year of social distancing. “Digging With Mr. Bull” turns the inconvenience of road construction into an exhilarating block party. Loveliest of all is “North Star Lullaby”; Peppa wrote the elegant, understated song for her 2-year-old brother, George. “I’d fly to space if I had wings,” she sings, her voice a near-whisper, “and play with George on Saturn’s rings.” The lullaby’s verses, written in iambic tetrameter, demonstrate a gift for poetic construction well beyond her years.
Yet Peppa’s Adventures is most compelling when Peppa departs from her standard chamber-pop formula. Lead single “Bing Bong Champion” is an ambitiously maximalist shot across the bow at those who called My First Album a Sarah Records retread. A tribute to sport in a fraught Olympic year, it moves with the grand air of Taylor Swift’s “State of Grace.” Chimes and brassy horns abound, but Peppa, a nimble vocalist, ably holds her own. On the bridge, she assumes the role of coach and leads her backing singers in rhythmic cheering. It is among her best work to date.
Similarly expansive is the opener and title track, “Peppa’s Adventures,” a celebration of the natural world. Like her contemporary Lorde’s “Solar Power,” the song throws off the past year’s miseries and flies through life with every pore open. “Adventures” relies heavily on a fiddle riff that recalls, or perhaps revives, the heyday of Mumford & Sons, the Lumineers, and Edward Sharpe. It’s a little gauche and though it doesn’t quite sink the song, it does raise questions about Peppa’s taste.
This minor concern aside, Peppa has proven herself a graceful navigator of a pop scene often hostile to her species. When My First Album debuted, in 2019, on the same day as Iggy Azalea’s In My Defense, Azalea cruelly threatened to turn Peppa into “a breakfast special.” In light of such attacks, Peppa’s unapologetic embrace of her identity is all the more inspirational. She oinks without shame; she celebrates “jumping in muddy puddles” on no fewer than four of this record’s nine tracks. “Birdy Birdy Woof Woof” demolishes preconceived notions about animal vocalists—“The birds go woof, and the dogs go tweet!”—as Peppa enlists friends and frequent collaborators Suzy Sheep, Pedro Pony, and Candy Cat to sing in one another’s styles.
The other political moments of Peppa’s Adventures are not as successful. “Recycling,” for all its delightful percussive flourishes, fails to consider the impact of the UK’s recycling programs on Southeast Asia, where landfills overflow with Western waste. A brief reference to private spaceflight in “The School Bus Song” is similarly ill-advised, given that billionaire astronauts continue to exploit the working-class and classroom-working listeners whom Peppa courts.
Peppa is, of course, a very young artist; one hopes that she will refine her political sensibility as she matures. Her influence, within and beyond the pop scene, is immense. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Peppa’s most devoted American fans have developed British accents and adopted her slang. Peppa seems to have borne up remarkably well in this position of influence, with all its attendant pressures. She clearly benefits from the closeness of her family and friends, who appear throughout Peppa’s Adventures. As her profile rises, and her music reaches an even wider audience, Peppa will need their support to stay grounded. If her abundantly successful new record signals one thing, it is this: Peppa is some pig.

Title: The Clinical And Physiological Importance Of Diffusion - 3


Description: “WAAA! WAAA! We have to do CARs? B-but why does a doctor need to learn how to read? You’re about to see why in this challenging but rewarding passage about diffusion, written and published in 1876. Alexa, play the world’s smallest violin.” 


Citation: “The Clinical And Physiological Importance Of Diffusion.” The British Medical Journal 1, no. 787 (1876): 136–38. http://www.jstor.org/stable/25242689.


Passage:
The description commonly given by physiologists of the blood-channels, namely, "a closed system of vessels," is doubtless, in one sense, accurate; and the fact that they are closed forms not only an important distinction between the circulation of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, but is also the indispensable foundation upon which is based the explanation of the various physical forces which cause the motion of the blood-current. Too absolute an adoption of this conception may, however, lead to error, as it may induce the physician to look upon the various constituents of the blood as completely confined within the limits of the vascular tree, and, under all circumstances, permanently shut up in the arteries and veins. One may thus be led to forget the mode in which the very object of circulation, namely, nutrition, is accomplished; the ultimate steps of which are, we know, carried on in the tissues themselves, outside the vessels, although the blood, which is the medium of transmission as well of the pabulum as of the waste products, under normal circumstances, never quits these closed channels. There must be, then, a constant interchange of fluid between the minute vessels and the tissues through which they pass.
The important subject of the physical phenomena governing these interchanges was made the subject of an able paper from the pen of Dr. George Johnson, which appeared in this Journal a few weeks ago. There it is clearly pointed out that the physical forces which control the unceasing movement of the interstitial fluids have even more interest for the clinical observer than for the physiologist, and deserve quite as much attention as the more obvious ones, which regulate the movement of the blood itself. As a familiar proof of the constancy and great rapidity with which the interchange of fluid takes place between the tissues and the blood, the author brings forward the extraordinarily rapid effects which follow the hypodermic use of medicines, which, in the space of a few minutes, are not only taken into the blood, but also permeate the non-vascular tissues, whence, after some little time, they are again taken, by the intervention of the blood, to some organ adapted for their ultimate removal from the system. The process by which this is, for the most part, accomplished is diffusion through the delicate membrane which forms the wall of the minute vessels. This mutual interchange—exosmosis and endosmosis—is constant, and the membranous vascular wall has an important part to play in the process, as it only admits of the free passage of certain constituents and retains others, just like the membrane of a dialyser through which the "crystalloids" can pass, while the "colloids" are retained in their former position. The albuminous bodies in the blood are thus retained in the vessels while the true solutions of salts readily escape, as is seen in most secretions, especially that of the kidney. The various tissues are then constantly soaked with the fluids of the blood which have filtered out of the vessels, and the surplus of fluid is constantly brought back into the blood by a similar process of diffusion.
In this way, the relative quantities of the fluid in the tissues and in the blood are kept in constant proportion one to the other, while the actual amount of watery constituents is, under normal circumstances, regulated by the kidneys, which act as overflow-pipes to the vessels, as well as outlets for the effete materials. When these important organs are damaged, and their function impeded, as happens in acute inflammatory disease, we must not be surprised to find edema as the result; for the oxidation-products are accumulated in the tissues, and the watery parts of the blood and the urinary crystalloids can no longer pass off by the kidneys, the vessels become overfilled with saline solutions, which soon pass into the tissues and waterlog them.
Questions:
A 35-year-old patient receives a hypodermic injection of a new medication. The doctor observes that the drug's effects become apparent throughout the patient's body within minutes. Which of the following is an application of the passage concepts to explain the rapid onset of the drug's effects? (Reasoning Within the Text,2)
1. The medication directly enters the patient's bloodstream through the injection site. 
2. The drug causes an immediate increase in blood flow throughout the body.

According to the passage, which of the following best describes the relationship between blood vessels and the tissues they supply? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. Blood directly enters the tissues from the vessels.
2. There is no exchange of substances between blood and tissues. 
3. A constant interchange of fluid occurs between vessels and tissues. (Correct)
4. Tissues receive nutrients only through specialized glands.


It is implied that the scientific community adopted the description of blood-channels as “a closed system of vessels” because it: (Foundations of Comprehension,2)

2. simplifies complex biological processes for easier understanding and communication.
3. reflects an outdated perspective that has not been challenged by new evidence.
4. supports a framework that distinguishes between different types of circulatory diseases.

2. an analysis that determines concentrations of saline in blood and tissue fluid.
3. using imaging technology to assess the elasticity of blood vessel walls.
4. an x-ray scan to visualize the exterior structure of the patient's kidneys. (Correct)

1. Salt molecules pass through vessel walls. 
2. Salts have a higher diffusion rate than albumin. 
3. The vascular wall acts like a dialyser membrane. (Correct)
4. Albumin is actively transported back into blood vessels.

1. Decreased retention of colloid in the bloodstream.
2. Reduced fluid exchange between blood and tissues.
3. Enhanced diffusion of albumin into the tissues. (Correct)
4. Critical chances of developing kidney failure.

1. Producing red blood cells. 
2. Purifying urine for excretion.
3. Storing excess fluids.
4. Acting as overflow-pipes for vessels. (Correct)
The author considers the description of blood-channels as “a closed system of vessels” as: (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. a description that accurately characterizes their most important functions.
2. incomplete as it fails to distinguish between vertebrates and invertebrates.
3. totemic of their nature but shouldn’t be taken at face value. (Correct)
4. needing change as it is entirely erroneous in its current application.


In the second paragraph, the author writes that "the various tissues are then constantly soaked with the fluids of the blood which have filtered out of the vessels, and the surplus of fluid is constantly brought back into the blood by a similar process of diffusion." Which of the following conditions would MOST disrupt the cyclic nature of this process? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,3)
1. Thickening of the vessel walls. (Correct)

Title: Material Darwinism - 3
Description: “Ah, another treatise on the meaning of life - because clearly what the world needs now is more philosophers arguing about whether our existence has any value whatsoever. And especially presenting it in a confusing way that makes me want to take a nap in my litterbox. A hard passage with hard questions.”
Citation: Brian F. Snyder. “The Darwinian Nihilist Critique of Environmental Ethics.” Ethics and the Environment 22, no. 2 (2017): 59–78. https://doi.org/10.2979/ethicsenviro.22.2.03.
Passage:
Sommers and Rosenberg (2003) make a strong case that materialistic Darwinism leads to nihilism. They define three philosophical alternatives: naturalism, nihilism, and intuitionism. That is, there are three options:
1. Values exist and they are derived from natural systems (naturalism);
2. Values do not exist and are illusionary (nihilism); or
3. Values exist and are derived from an intuition about a metaphysical reality (intuitionism).
To Sommers and Rosenberg, intuitionism is the idea that we can know things about objective reality using non-empirical means and would include all types of theism. For naturalists, intuitionism must be rejected because it completely undermines materialism and Darwinism. That is, if we can know things about objective reality without empiricism, then the entire enterprise of science falls apart. If we can intuit that man was created by God 6000 years ago, and if that intuition is as valid as the fossil record, then science is useless. Thus, a secular materialist must reject intuitionism. To the materialist, empiricism is the only valid epistemology for understanding the universe.
The rejection of intuitionism for the materialist leaves either naturalism or nihilism. Sommers and Rosenberg define naturalism as combining three theses: a) Normative terms that name intrinsic values and categorical obligations denote real properties of things or acts. b) There are true or well-justified synthetic propositions about which items or actions instantiate these properties. c) There exists a set of scientifically accessible natural facts about us or the world that can justify (a) and explain the truth or well-groundedness of (b).
Darwinian naturalism is the further claim that the theory of natural selection is the set of scientifically accessible facts referred to in thesis (c). Sommers and Rosenberg argue that all naturalists must be Darwinian naturalists because “ethical beliefs...guide conduct that makes a difference for survival and reproduction...Naturalists are committed to the thesis that if there are ethical truths, it must have been adaptive to believe them” (659). In other words, due to the explanatory power of natural selection in animal and human behavior, Darwinian naturalism is the only variety of defensible naturalism—there is no other set of scientifically accessible natural facts about the world that can explain theses (a) and (b) above.
But, to Sommers and Rosenberg, Darwinian naturalism is oxymoronic. The core of Darwinism is that it is a value-neutral process. The results of the process of evolution by natural selection are neither good nor bad, nor are they teleological. Thus, Darwinism cannot justify the existence of normative terms that name intrinsic values and categorical obligations. For example, group selection can lead to altruistic behavior (Trivers 1971) and it can even lead us to laud altruistic behavior because it is in our own adaptive self-interest, but it has no means to impart altruism with objective good. As Sommers and Rosenberg argue, “If all apparently purposive processes, states, events, and conditions are in reality the operation of a purely mechanical substrate-neutral algorithm, then as far as explanatory tasks go, the only values we need to attribute to biological systems are instrumental ones. An evolutionary account of moral belief will not only explain ethics, but it will explain it away” (661).
Without objective value or meaning, ethics cannot prescribe objectively correct or objectively right behavior. Instead, ethics are limited to prescribing subjectively ethical behavior. In other words, the ethicist can argue that “X is good, therefore do Y,” but this argument is implicitly based on the philosopher’s subjective assumption about what is good. Because it lacks any defensible claim to objectivity, the ethical admonition is the philosopher’s attempt to compel a subject to act according to the philosopher’s own subjective assumptions about right and wrong; that is, it is an exercise in the philosopher’s will to power.
Questions:
What is NOT a goal of this passage? (Reasoning Within the Text,1)
1. To argue the inability of ethics to appraise behavior given certain limiting conditions. 
2. To discuss ethical values and their relation to three philosophical theories.
3. To provide evidence of intuitionism’s inferiority as a philosophical belief. (Correct)
4. To explain a view on why materialistic Darwinism leads to nihilism.


What does the passage suggest about Darwinian naturalism? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. It combines the principles of natural selection with the belief in intrinsic moral values.
2. It asserts that ethical beliefs evolved because they benefit survival and reproduction. (Correct)
3. It claims that values are derived from a supernatural source.
4. It supports the idea that science can coexist with non-empirical knowledge.


How does the author view the relationship between Darwinism and ethics? (Reasoning Within the Text,2)
1. The author believes Darwinism provides a strong foundation for ethical beliefs.
2. The author suggests that ethics and Darwinism are completely unrelated.
3. The author argues that Darwinism is incompatible with objective ethical values. (Correct)
4. The author thinks Darwinism supports the idea of moral absolutes.


The author’s uses the example “man was created by God 6000 years ago, and if that intuition is as valid as the fossil record, then science is useless” to illustrate: (Reasoning Within the Text,1)
1. the fallacy in holding both naturalism and intuitionism as beliefs. (Correct)

Title: Emptiness In Cinema - 2
Description: “Nothing says "fun summer blockbuster" quite like eerie emptiness and omnipresent existential dread. Pro-tip with zombies: if you lay on the floor, they can’t eat you. Five second rule. Meow!”
Citation: Walter, Martin. “Landscapes of Loss: The Semantics of Empty Spaces in Contemporary Post-Apocalyptic Fiction.” In Empty Spaces: Perspectives on Emptiness in Modern History: Perspectives on Emptiness in Modern History, edited by Courtney J. Campbell, Allegra Giovine, and Jennifer Keating, 133–50. University of London Press, 2019. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvp2n2r8.13.
Passage: 
As a cinematographic feature, emptiness has had a long and continuing history, often contributing to the specific genre conventions of a film. Film noir, in particular, has extensively relied on empty or abandoned city spaces, such as, for example, the destroyed post-war landscapes of Vienna in The Third Man (1949). Moreover, it has also seen a recent revival as part of the ongoing success of post-apocalyptic fiction, such as in the empty city streets of New York City in I Am Legend (2009) or the grim I of The Road. Drawing particularly on motifs of destruction and decay, the visual aesthetics of emptiness have given a new meaning to empty cities, which has also led to an increase in representations of ruins, for example in photography and exhibitions.
The industrial city of Detroit and its economic decline have, for instance, become an active canvas for artists on which they inscribe and visualize what has been described as "America’s most epic urban failure," with the city coming "to stand for nothing so much as its own emptiness and vulnerability." Empty spaces, then, not only document the city’s painful decline but also mirror what Camilo Vergara has called an "eerie emptiness." In the context of urban spaces, emptiness is a familiar and recurring motif. Exploring the dynamics of anxiety and sublime beauty that are associated with places of ruin, she argued that post-apocalyptic narratives also "render our own society as other and encourage us to ask whether the empire of capital represents lasting progress or a road to decline."
If emptiness has come to be associated with feelings of anxiety or failure and has at the same time become a familiar sight – for example, in the form of empty high streets or abandoned houses – it seems plausible to suggest that images of a post-apocalyptic setting are already "inscribed" in contemporary discourses of emptiness. In Living in the End Times, Slavoj Žižek has argued that under the conditions of late capitalism, catastrophe "is renormalized, perceived as part of the normal run of things, as always already having been possible." In the wake of the recent "war on terror" he argued that before 11 September 2001 (or "9/11") the use of torture was "dismissed as an ethical catastrophe" but that "once it happened, it retroactively grounded its own possibility, and we immediately got accustomed to it." Fictional accounts of the apocalypse can also work as reminders that what is presented as a feature of a future society is already an established fact of its extra-textual reality and already present in the form of accepted beliefs and ideologies.
While there is a group dynamic present in many post-apocalyptic narratives, not only does the absence of familiar sights and sounds increase the feeling of unease, but the new spatiality also challenges seemingly natural everyday practices, such as communication between individuals. In the hostile, zombie-ridden environment of The Walking Dead, bodily integrity then becomes the primary goal for the group of survivors, as empty city corners, large plains or abandoned buildings become the epitome of risk and danger that may lurk at any and every point.
To a large degree, the fragmentary or empty character of spaces symbolizes an omnipresent threat of vulnerability and usually works as a first reminder that the familiarity of spaces has been disturbed. This is apparent in situations where the protagonists meet other survivors. Both in The Walking Dead and in Survivors, the immediate danger emanating from abandoned spaces is manifested in the genre conventions as part of which strangers become a possible danger – they are rendered an unfamiliar sight in otherwise empty surroundings. Gordon Coonfield has hinted at the fact that in the largely anonymized space of the city, where people look at their smartphones, meeting strangers is taken for granted "as natural, even rational forms of collectivity and social organization," while historically it was common for face-to-face communities not only to exclude strangers as "others" but also to live in larger isolation. The representation of meeting strangers in these series, then, seemingly reconnects to a historical form of social contact as part of which strangers are not seen as belonging to a suffering collective but are conceived as a threat. Playing around with familiarity leads to feelings of uncanniness in spaces that appear uncontrollable and in which everybody can become a possible danger. Meeting strangers is also symbolic of the post-9/11 notion of "the enemy within."

Title: Prometheus vs. Daedelus - 3
Description: In 1923, a genetics professor had a prophecy. Why doesn’t anyone have any nice prophecies? Everyone is going to get free tuna for the rest of their lives – yippee! Case closed! You get to be a doctor! You get to be a doctor!

Passage:
In 1923, the famed genetics professor J.B.S. Haldane, demonstrating a penchant for provocation and prophecy, gave a talk on the future of science. He claimed that scientific research would flourish in the years to come and that he would make no prophecies rasher than those made by H.G. Wells in his works. One very important aspect of science, to Haldane, had been left out of Wells’s imagination due to the shifting scientific interests of different times: the development of the biological sciences. Physics and chemistry, with their 'scientific ideas [...] of flying and radiotelegraphy,' were, by 1923, merely 'commercial problems,' whereas, he believed, the future 'center of scientific interest [lay] in biology.' Some of his prophecies were radical but proved quite accurate. Haldane was the first to foresee the necessary shift in energy production, from coal and oil to wind and sunlight, and proposed hydrogen-powered machinery. Regarding biology, his claims were the most outrageous and garnered the strongest opposition at the time. In a science-fictional essay, supposedly to be read by an undergraduate student of Cambridge University in 2073, on the development of biology in the twentieth century, he claimed, among other things, the birth of the first test-tube baby and genetic selection. His account was rather optimistic, both in terms of time frame (positing 1951 as the birth date of the first child by in vitro fertilization, whereas in reality, it took until 1977) and in terms of its potential to alter the species and offer 'great possibilities in the way of the direct improvement of the individual.'
What is even more interesting than his claim about the importance of biological scientific progress, genetics in particular, is his claim that the inevitable human reaction towards it is repulsion. Drawing on the Greek mythological figures of Prometheus and Daedalus, Haldane argues that the chemical or physical inventor is always a Prometheus. There is no great invention, from fire to flying, which has not been hailed as an insult to some god. But if every physical and chemical invention is a blasphemy, every biological invention is a perversion. There is hardly one which would not appear as indecent and unnatural. Whereas Prometheus would be subject to the revenge of the gods, Daedalus—for his biological creation of the Minotaur—would go unpunished by Zeus and Poseidon. Instead, Haldane claims, the biologist is faced with 'the universal and agelong reprobation of a humanity to whom biological inventions are abhorrent.' The physicist threatens divine power to claim it for humanity, becoming in stature a god himself (or a titan, as Prometheus), and by his creation, in effect, granting humanity its superior status. In contrast, the biologist (especially the geneticist) threatens humanity, robbing it of its natural place, and is thus seen as a threat to and corruption of the human claim to godliness. Prometheus stole fire from the gods, bringing the light of progress to humanity and securing for himself a token position in the mythology of humankind. However, Daedalus’s inventions served as warnings that technology never quite turned out for the good and always demanded a price that was too high to pay—the youths of Athens sacrificed to the Minotaur.
The Prometheus myth carries with it the utopian vision of a better future for humanity—fire, light, and technological progress facilitate this change and allow for a utopian view of what is to come. The hero himself might be punished by the gods, but his deed allowed for humanity to grow and become stronger. The myth of Daedalus is born of a similar utopian vision—his inventions are ingenious and tell of humanity’s potential for technological progress. However, the tables are turned when it comes to the repercussions. When Daedalus builds a device for the cursed queen of Crete, Pasiphae, which allows her to be mounted by the Minoan bull, and thus in effect helps birth the first xenogenetic creation, the Minotaur, it is not he that is punished but humankind. Because the Minotaur is an unnatural creation, its abhorrent nature shows in its diet of human flesh. From the bull that was supposed to be sacrificed springs forth a monster, to which humans must regularly be sacrificed to keep it appeased. Unwittingly, Daedalus had punished humanity for his unnatural creation by not considering the long-term effects of what he had invented. His tale, as utopian in vision as it might be, rather shows a dystopian stance towards social and technological progress—it is a cautionary tale.

Passage: 
“Relinquish all hope, ye who enter here.”
Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto III, 9


Some 700 years ago, Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) wrote an epic poem about a man’s journey through the afterworlds of hell, purgatory, and heaven. In his Divine Comedy, he cataloged the vices and virtues of people who had passed into those spiritual domains, providing valuable insights for the living. Dante describes hell as a very unhappy and inhospitable place with nine different levels, ranging from the blazing inferno of the eternally damned to the rather benign First Circle, reserved for worthy individuals who were born before the world was redeemed and therefore could not enter the gates of heaven (Alighieri, 1947).
Within this general metaphor, this chapter will take the reader on an educational journey through the various levels of scientific misconduct, from unintentional but questionable research practices, such as citation bias, to serious scientific fraud, such as the fabrication of data. Our purpose is not to instill fear but to illustrate the consequences of scientific misconduct so that we can learn how to avoid them. Table 14.1 shows the seven types of misconduct explored in this chapter. In addition to describing these various "sins" and the people who commit them, we also discuss their relative seriousness, the punishments that can result, and how to prevent these kinds of problems before they arise. 
  

The first issue is carelessness, exemplified by unconscious or conscious citation bias, misrepresenting the accomplishments or findings of others, and neglecting to reference findings that an informed reader would need to interpret the author’s conclusions. In its most benign form, this problem consists of a failure to read and understand the articles one cites. A more serious offense is the distortion of others’ work so that their ideas or findings support a preconceived point of view that the author is trying to advance. Carelessness can also be manifested in poor management or inaccurate presentation of data. The second ethical issue is dual and redundant publication, which occurs when two or more articles share any of the same data without full cross-referencing. The third issue is unfair or irresponsible authorship. According to standard Ethical Practice Guidelines published by the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE) and similar guidelines of other organizations (e.g., Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), all persons named as authors must meet certain criteria.
Failure to declare a conflict of interest (COI) is the fourth ethical issue considered in this chapter. A COI is a situation or relationship in which professional, personal, or financial considerations could be seen by a fair-minded person as potentially in conflict with the researcher’s or author’s independence of judgment. The fifth ethical violation is the failure to conform to minimum standards of protection for animal subjects or human research participants. The latter includes confidentiality of patient records and other data, informed consent, and proper explanation of the risks of research participation. Abiding by standards set by national and institutional boards for the protection of animal or human subjects is an important aspect of research under this rubric. 
Plagiarism is the sixth issue. Plagiarism literally means the act of “literary theft” by using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author as if they were one’s own. The final level is scientific fraud. This form of misconduct consists of the deliberate fabrication of data or the alteration of findings to make a study more credible and acceptable for publication. 
A meta-analysis of survey studies conducted by research scientists and their student trainees across various disciplines indicates that up to 33.7% admit to engaging in questionable research practices, and 0.3%–4.9% have fabricated or falsified data. Misconduct is reported more frequently by medical and pharmacological researchers than those from other disciplines. How prevalent are these various ethical problems among addiction scientists? ISAJE conducted an informal survey of its members to learn about the kinds of ethical misbehavior most concerning to journal editors. Duplicate publication and inappropriate citations were the most common problems encountered by journal editors in their routine processing of manuscripts. A substantial number of journals had experienced more serious forms of scientific misconduct, such as plagiarism and failure to declare conflicts of interest (COI). Authorship problems were also noted quite often. Although most problems were considered infrequent occurrences by the editors, it is likely that these issues are often hidden from the eyes of busy editors and reviewers. For example, editors and reviewers are unlikely to detect scientific fraud in the normal editorial process because data fabrication can be easily hidden in lab records and computer files that are inaccessible during the review process. Skilled reviewers are more likely to detect plagiarism and citation bias, but there is a general suspicion that the cases of identified and provable misconduct are just the tip of the iceberg.

Passage:
Humans have long defined, assessed, analyzed, and calculated data as factors in navigating reality. Indeed, the rules for what constitutes data, together with the logics of their assembly, form a core component of culture. Whether omens or numbers, whether qualitative or quantitative, whether involving heuristics, hermeneutics, or the rules of mathematics, the dyad of data and their organizing schemes give cultural eras their specificity. Considering developments ranging from Mayan astronomical calendars to Copernicus’s heliocentric observations, from seventeenth-century navigational charts to twentieth-century actuarial tables, one might argue that this dyad underpins cultural possibility itself.
Data has never been more abundant than it is today. Its unprecedented quantity owes as much to the digital encoding of most traceable phenomena as to the production of data by actors beyond our species. Whereas in the past, human observation translated events in the world into data, today, networked non-human actors are capable of directly generating machine-readable data. But, as in the past, all that data would be meaningless without an organizing scheme. Behind the quintillions of bytes, behind our computers’ ever-growing processing power, is an organizing scheme in the form of the algorithm. Like data, algorithms can be human- or machine-generated. And although an ancient idea, the algorithm has—or so I will argue—reached a tipping point in terms of its cultural operations: it is now being deployed in ways that redefine long-held subject-object relationships and, in doing so, poses some rather fundamental epistemological questions.
This shift in the balance of things has produced its share of anxieties, as familiar ways of doing things seem superseded by ‘the algorithm’. The recent explosion of headlines where the term ‘algorithm’ figures prominently and often apocalyptically suggests that we are re-enacting a familiar ritual in which ‘new’ technologies appear in the regalia of disruption. But the emerging algorithmic regime is more than ‘just another’ temporarily unruly new technology. My thesis is that the algorithm—an approach to problem-solving that dates back at least to Euclid’s Elements (ca. 300 BC) and saw significant development under Leibniz and Pascal—has achieved new force as a cultural technology thanks to a confluence of factors including the emergence of big data, intensive processing power, and high-speed networks. It alters the subject-object relationship hard-wired in the project of the modern era and visible in technologies like the printing press and three-point perspective, both of which amplify individual agency. Yet, like these technologies, the algorithm, combined with data, can be read as defining an emerging epistemic era. If we are indeed like those in the early fifteenth century who were poised on the edge of a new order of things, will we, like some of them, be inclined to embrace the potential for a new vision of ourselves in the world, a new social order? Or will we miss the radical potential of a new technology, retrofitting it to serve the still-dominant interests of the old?
Technologies do not, in themselves, change anything, but rather are socially constructed and deployed. So as we watch the possibilities of a new technology take shape in the hands of those with the greatest economic power, we have good reason to be anxious. The dyad of big data and algorithms can enable new cultural and social forms, or they can be made to reinforce the most egregious aspects of our present social order.

Passage:
Game of Thrones (GoT), the hit TV series based on George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels, has had a significant impact on contemporary pop culture. With record-breaking viewership and critical acclaim, it has spawned an active and productive fandom across social media and fanfiction archives. Set in the imagined world of Westeros, the series charts the feuds and struggles of powerful families over the Iron Throne, seat of the monarchy unifying the seven kingdoms. A central question in GoT is power and authority - who can and should rule Westeros, and what gives anyone the right?
The construction of authority in GoT can be analyzed through sociologist Max Weber's influential typology of legitimate rule, which outlines three types: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic. Traditional authority is frequently patriarchal, gaining legitimacy through appeal to history and custom. In GoT, this is the dominant form, embodied by fathers ruling families, lords ruling lands, and kings ruling kingdoms. However, traditional authority is shown to be in crisis, with its legitimacy constantly threatened. Rational-legal authority bases its legitimacy in law and reason, seen in elected leaders and institutions. This type is constructed as relatively weak in GoT's feudal setting. Charismatic authority relies on the perceived special qualities of individuals, like cult leaders or revolutionaries. Interestingly, GoT constructs charismatic authority as more effective than the other types, despite Western culture's typical skepticism of charismatic rule since the fallout of 20th century dictatorships.
A key statement in the discursive construction of authority in GoT is that authority is created by belief in and acceptance of authority. There is nothing natural or a priori about it. This is illustrated when Tywin Lannister observes of a rival claimant: "He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North." The verb "worship" constructs the leader as charismatic, while the conditional "as long as" emphasizes the contingent nature of authority.
The strongest construction of charismatic authority operates through the character of Daenerys Targaryen. Though she initially calls on traditional authority as the last of an old dynasty, her authority is primarily charismatic, maintained through displays of miraculous deeds and hints of divine origin. Key scenes show her emerging unscathed from fire with newly-hatched dragons, or being lifted on the shoulders of adoring crowds who hail her as their "mother". Camera techniques construct her charisma visually, with pans picking her out as special amid masses of followers.
However, charismatic authority is not infallible. Daenerys's rule is ultimately backed by force - her dragons - and when other means fail, she is prepared to kill enemies. Even so, charismatic authority is constructed as the strongest and most successful kind in GoT. This reflects the overall discursive formation, where the primary condition of authority is belief. Traditional patriarchal authority may be dominant, but it is unstable and often ineffective. Rational-legal authority is weak in the feudal setting. Charismatic authority, while also fallible, emerges as the most potent form.
This construction of authority in GoT provides a lens for examining real-world power structures. It suggests that even seemingly entrenched systems of traditional or legal authority ultimately rest on belief and acceptance. Charismatic figures who can inspire devoted followings may be able to upend existing power structures, for better or worse. The show's popularity may shape viewers' understanding of political authority as more contingent and personality-driven than commonly assumed.
At the same time, this framework reflects back on the authority of the author and text itself. Martin asserts strong authorial authority over his work, famously prohibiting fanfiction. Yet fans challenge this through their transformative works, demonstrating that textual authority also rests on audience acceptance. The very existence of a thriving fanfiction community, despite the author's wishes, enacts the principle that authority requires belief to function. In this way, the discourse around authority within and beyond the text becomes a site for negotiating the legitimacy of creative production and reception in contemporary media culture.
Questions:
Tywin Lannister states that “Any king who says ‘I am the king’ is no true king.” If taken in tandem with his arguments in the third paragraph, what is implied by this statement? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. Self-belief is entirely unnecessary to become king. 
2. Without formal legal processes the king cannot be an authority.
3. Traditional authority is ineffective compared to charismatic authority.
4. A king without subjects cannot claim to call himself an authority. (Correct)

2. Traditional authority
3. Rational-legal authority
1. I only 
2. I and II (Correct)
3. I, II, and III
4. I and III 


According to a study on Latin American regimes, it’s discovered that most charismatic leaders tend to be ineffective rulers compared to rational-legal leaders and yet still command an impressive amount of support. How does that affect the central argument of the passage? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. It has no effect on the argument because the passage only explains how authority is constructed.
2. It weakens the argument that charismatic authority is not infallible and must be supported by other types. 
3. It weakens the argument that charismatic authority is the most effective in the show Game of Thrones.
4. It strengthens the notion that authority is mainly constructed by belief rather than actual governing ability. (Correct)
According to the passage, which of the following “camera techniques” was likely used to construct Daenarys’ charisma? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,1)
1. decreasing the saturation to match her skin tone to her followers.
2. lowering the camera for an upwards-angle shot of Daenerys. 
3. zooming in on her skin to reveal her resistance to fire.
4. framing her in a shot that isolates her from her followers. (Correct)
In the context of the passage, which of the following best explains why the author discusses Martin's prohibition of fanfiction and the subsequent fan response? (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. to illustrate the limitations of charismatic authority in modern media culture. 
2. to demonstrate the fallibility of rational-legal authority.
3. to provide an example of how authority requires acceptance to function. (Correct)
4. to argue that fan-created content enhances the original work's legitimacy.
Which of the following claims does the author provide the least support? (Reasoning Within the Text,1)

3. “Rational-legal authority is weak in the feudal setting.” (Correct)
4. “The strongest construction of charismatic authority operates through the character of Daenerys Targaryen.”
The author claims that Game of Thrones “provides a lens for examining real-world power structures.” Thus, it follows that the author must believe: (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. television accurately depicts modern-day society.
2. interpretations of art have ontological merit.
3. media created by a society reflects that society. (Correct)
4. universal truths can be revealed through media.

Title: Surrealism and Entropy - 3
Description: “Man, if you want to learn about surrealism and entropy, try doing catnip and quaaludes. This is a hard but fun passage on art – weirdly the hardest topic on MCAT CARs?”

Passage:
Since its inception, Surrealism has been associated with conservative art forms aspiring to a higher synthetic unity, unlike those modern art movements such as Pop Art or installation art, which have eschewed aesthetic and transcendental values in favor of the purely material and commercial. In Displaying the Marvelous, Lewis Kachur writes that Breton was 'holding fast to Surrealism as "high" art'. According to Hal Foster, 'reconciliation is the raison d'être of Bretonian Surrealism', whereby the binding or 'synthetic principle' underlying Surrealist works is Eros and 'the uncanny is recorded as the marvelous and arrested animation is sublimated as convulsive beauty'. Rosalind Krauss characterizes Surrealist visuality as the dissolving of writing and vision, vision and presentation into 'the higher synthesis of Surreality'.
One noteworthy challenge to this prevailing view of Surrealist art has been formulated by Elza Adamowicz in her work on Surrealist collage. For her, Surrealist works are chaotic, sprawling and fragmentary entities. They are "monstrous proliferating shapes both material and metaphoric, never achieving closure. The organic unity of classical statuary is replaced in these works by an aesthetics of the hypertropic detail, its euphoric complete forms giving way to the disturbing hybridity of the informe.
The observation that Surrealist works are fundamentally ill-defined, unending and 'informe' (or formless) — a term one naturally associates with the philosopher Georges Bataille — seems astute, since it accurately describes those aspects of the Surrealist aesthetic (based on disharmony and disunity) which have all too often been overlooked. One type of formlessness, which, I believe, also encapsulates these qualities, providing a useful theoretical model to explain how Surrealist art is realized, is entropy.
Entropy is the phenomenon of irreversible and disorderly energy exchange between two closed systems. An example of such closed systems are ice cubes melting in a warm drink, whereby the ice absorbs the heat energy of the drink, and progressively loses its molecular 'order' to the hotter liquid into which it dissolves. Ice and drink thus begin to blend chaotically and irrevocably into one. Whereas the term was originally used to define the second law of thermodynamics, it is now used within a variety of subdisciplines within science (including cosmology), as well as having extended applications within sociology and the arts.
I do not want to suggest that the incorporation of entropy by Surrealists into their artworks was in any way programmatic or even intentional. Indeed, I in no way seek to reappraise authorial intentionality, which in the case of the Surrealists would be ill-advised, given the fine line they often trod between conscious and unconscious methods of art-making. I want rather to consider how the Surrealists, in their works, came to operate the notion of entropy despite themselves.
In his article entitled 'Le Puits et la pyramide', Jacques Derrida states: "Malgré l'idéalité de la lumière et du regard, les objets perçus par l'œil, par exemple les œuvres d'art plastique, persistent au-delà de la perception dans leur existence sensible, extérieure, têtue; ils résistent à l'Aufhebung, ne se laissent pas, en tant que tels, absolument relever par l'intériorité temporelle. Ils freinent le travail de la dialectique."
I believe that Surrealist works exemplify Derrida's comment concerning the resistance of art to dialectical sublation on account of their hybridity. In bringing together arbitrary elements within their iconography, the Surrealists created a monstrous entre-deux. In their material finality, Surrealist works did not, in my view, express the élan towards a higher unity, but rather the pain and rupture of subjects being displaced from their usual surroundings and merged into an unnatural agglomeration (Lautréamont's image of the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on a dissecting table — oft-cited by the Surrealists — springs to mind). The creation of Surrealist works was contingent upon irreversible amalgamations between entirely disparate elements, amalgamations which gave the works their unique identity.
Questions:
The content of the passage is organized by: (Reasoning Within the Text,2)
1. a chronological account of surrealism’s development throughout history. 
2. analyzing accounts of surrealist artists to ascertain the art’s true nature.
3. debating the synthesis model using scholarly opinions and the author's own insights. (Correct)

4. an orderly arrangement of diverse elements forming a transcendent whole.


What did Derrida likely mean when he said "les objets perçus par l'œil, par exemple les œuvres d'art plastique, persistent au-delà de la perception dans leur existence sensible, extérieure, têtue”? (Reasoning Within the Text,2)
1. Surrealist art resists perception as a unified whole. (Correct)
2. Objects cannot exist beyond our sensible perception.
3. The interior world of art is absolute and finite.
4. The persistent nature of our senses creates objects.

1. Darwin’s theory of evolution: complexity emerges from simpler forms through gradual adaptation. 
2. Newton’s third law: every action has an equal or opposite reaction.
3. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle: pairs of properties cannot be precisely measured simultaneously. 
4. Erwin Schrödinger’s quantum superpositioning: a system can exist in multiple states at once. (Correct)


The author’s stance on the nature of Surrealist art can be best described as: (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. ill-defined, unending and informal.
2. in stark opposition to Rosalind Krauss.
3. similar to Adamowicz’ definition. (Correct)
4. lacking restraint in its broad remarks.

2. It has little impact on the argument, as the author's use of entropy is metaphorical rather than strictly scientific. (Correct)
3. It strengthens the argument by highlighting the innovative nature of applying entropy to Surrealist art.
4. It renders the argument invalid, as scientific concepts can only be applied within their original field of study.

Passage:


In massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft (WoW), large numbers of players come together in a complex online environment not only to defeat monsters and each other in return for virtual gold and armor but also to turn their avatars into colorful characters by roleplaying them. The ambiguity of play in these environments is encapsulated by the concept of the "magic circle," a term that describes how games proceed within their own boundaries of time and space, absorbing players into a separate world set apart from ordinary life. However, this concept is increasingly challenged by the reality of how games interact with and are influenced by everyday life.
The notion of the magic circle, which resonates with references to "walled off" magic rites, places, supernatural powers, and illusions, can blind us to the complex and ambiguous qualities of games and gameplay. The idea that a game exists within a magic circle, separate from real life, oversimplifies the interaction between the game world and the player's actual life. For instance, when playing WoW, one is not merely engaged in an isolated virtual world but is constantly negotiating the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions of the gameplay experience. This process of negotiation shapes not only roleplay in MMORPGs but also games and gameplay in general.
The emergence of Fantasy gaming culture from the 1970s onwards, exemplified by WoW, ties in with the development of what Manuel Castells termed the "network society." In his trilogy The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture, Castells maps how, from the late 1960s onwards, society has shifted from hierarchies to networks in all sectors, driven by the information technology revolution, the economic crisis of both capitalism and statism, and the rise of cultural social movements such as feminism and environmentalism. While Castells focused on sociopolitical forms of social interaction, online networks of play are also important global and distributed forms of sociability.
The magic circle concept, first popularized by Johan Huizinga in Homo Ludens and later adopted by game designers and researchers such as Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, suggests that games create a new reality defined by their rules, separate from the ordinary world. However, this separation is not as clear-cut as the metaphor suggests. Games are not closed systems but are influenced by and interact with the real world, blurring the lines between game and non-game, online and offline.
In trying to find a way around the "magic" and "strong boundaries" of the magic circle metaphor, some researchers have reformulated it. Edward Castronova, for example, described MMORPGs as having a "porous membrane" through which people constantly cross, carrying their real-world attitudes and behaviors into the game world. This perspective acknowledges the fluidity between game and non-game spaces, recognizing that the valuation of things in cyberspace becomes enmeshed with their valuation in the real world.
Role-playing in WoW further challenges the magic circle. Role-play in MMORPGs is a contested form of play, even on servers designated for role-playing. Although technically optional, role-playing in WoW involves constant negotiation between players about acceptable gameplay and behavior. This negotiation process is shaped by the game's code, cultural conventions, and the interpersonal relationships between players and their characters. Role-playing is a collaborative experience in which players create shared fantasies by negotiating which situations or events can be part of the collective game narrative.
The concept of the magic circle is thus problematic in that it reinforces a dichotomy between the real and the imaginary, obscuring the complexity of actual games and play. A more useful approach is to view games as part of a networked society where every game and gameplay experience is negotiated spatially, temporally, and socially. By shifting the focus from a study of games in culture to a study of gameplay as one of the elements that produce culture, we can better understand the fluid and dynamic nature of play in online role-playing games like WoW.
Questions:
Based on the passage, how does the author's view of role-playing in World of Warcraft challenge the traditional concept of the "magic circle"? (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. By claiming that video games are not truly immersive experiences.
2. By asserting that players violate the designated boundaries of the game world.

2. providing historical context for the development of fantasy gaming culture. (Correct)
3. demonstrating that MMORPGs are primarily tools for economic exchange.
4. arguing that online games are more hierarchical than other social networks.
If a study found that long-term MMORPG players showed increased ability to navigate complex social situations in real life, this finding would most strongly support which of the author's arguments? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. The magic circle accurately describes the separation between game worlds and reality.
2. Role-playing in MMORPGs is a contested form of play that requires constant negotiation.
3. Games like World of Warcraft are part of a broader shift towards a network society.

2. It oversimplifies the complexity of gameplay experiences. 
3. It reinforces a dichotomy between the real and the imaginary. 
4. It acknowledges the fluid interaction between game and non-game spaces. (Correct)
“Leroy Jenkins” is a famous internet meme where a player unexpectedly charges into battle in WoW while shouting his name, disrupting his group's carefully planned strategy.

Passage:
I met a traveler from an antique land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Passage: 
Most developed stock exchanges around the world are considered “liquid,” and shareholders are able to sell their shares quickly, at a fair price, and at a low cost. In addition, shareholders know at any given point that they can sell their shares, and even if they don’t wish to sell, they know the value of their holdings. Because of this enhanced liquidity and transparency in pricing, shareholders are willing to supply capital to the stock market. In economics, we typically solve the “scarcity” problem by allowing the market to decide what will be produced and which firms will produce it. An efficiently functioning stock market, similarly, helps allocate scarce investment capital. If the market was poorly regulated and operationally inefficient, then it is likely that we would face an inefficient allocation of capital.
In order to induce investors to provide capital to the stock market, they need to know that there is a level playing field and that the market is not skewed in the direction of investors with privileged information. If investors do not hold this view, then they will be unwilling to supply capital to the market, and this will inhibit economic growth.
When a company makes the decision to go public, there is a recognition that the consequent reporting requirements are much more stringent than when it was privately owned. A privately owned company is required to publish annual reports, but when a company goes public, the extent of the information that is required to be made known is increased. In the US, this is referred to as the 10K form. In addition to this, companies are required to submit a 10Q form to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are also numerous other forms that may need to be submitted, depending on the firm’s activities. Forms 3, 4, and 13D, for example, are commonly used, as they detail changes in ownership. As a result of this scrutiny, potential suppliers of capital view the firm with enhanced confidence and are more likely to invest.
While the rules and regulations vary around the world, the basic premise of an acquisition is that if one company wants to take over another company, this can be achieved by simply buying the stock in the stock market. The motives for such an acquisition are numerous but include gaining market share or technology and/or the replacement of inefficient management. Stocks that are publicly quoted are exposed to acquisitions, whereas the shares in privately owned companies are not.
The efficient market hypothesis was developed in 1970 by Eugene Fama, who defined three key forms of market efficiency. In the weak form, current market prices reflect all historical information about a company. In the semi-strong form, the information from the weak form is supplemented by current publicly available information about the company. Finally, the strong form requires stock prices to reflect the information included in both the weak and semi-strong forms, as well as privately held information. This is the most stringent form of market efficiency as it includes “insider” information.
One implication of a stock market having semi-strong form efficiency is that if new information relating to a company is released, the market should immediately process this information rationally, determining whether it has a positive or a negative impact on share prices and adjusting market prices accordingly. The speed of information incorporation is assumed to be so fast that there is no opportunity to buy the shares between information release and incorporation into the price. This ensures that the market is a level playing field.

Title: Swimming Pool Construction - 3
Description: “Nothing quite like a riveting passage on pool plumbing to get the heart racing - because who doesn't love spending their free time calculating pipe diameters and water renewal rates instead of, you know, actually swimming?”

Passage:
The customary source of supply is the municipal or domestic system of the locality. There is no reason why a river, lake, or ocean may not be directly drawn upon if one investigates and is sure there is no contaminating element present. If the domestic supply is tapped and the pressure is low or uncertain, the inlet to the pool must be above the highest possible level of water in the pool or a check valve must be installed in the inflow pipe to prevent any possibility of pool water backing up into the domestic pipes. The size of the municipal main should be ascertained in order to figure the time required for filling the pool, especially when renewal at frequent intervals is proposed. Otherwise, the use of the pool may be restricted by a long period of filling. The contents of a pool in gallons may be computed by multiplying the cubical contents up to water level by 7.48, the number of gallons per cubic foot.
If no hydraulic tables are available at the moment, a fair approximation of the diameter of the pipe necessary to fill a pool in any given time may be made as follows: Find the length of the supply pipe from the pool to the point where the main is tapped. Also, measure the height of that point above or below the pool inlet and the capacity of the pool in cubic feet. 
It is almost always more accurate and more convenient to solve these various hydraulic problems by reference to tables, of which those prepared by Williams and Hazen are perhaps the best, which give the velocity, discharge, etc., for pipes of all ordinary diameters and materials for varying pressures. Care should be taken not to interfere with the domestic supply, and it is wise to figure on filling the pool in the night hours, say from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., with a slower flow if possible. It is seldom feasible to use a supply pipe of a diameter over 4 inches. This will fill a pool of capacity of 15,000 gallons under ordinary conditions in about two hours. A 3-inch pipe will require approximately twice as long, and a 2-inch pipe nearly six times as long.
In considering the quality of the water, its freedom from coloration is an important matter; the clearer, the more attractive the pool will be. Sediment is not so serious, as it may be filtered out before the water enters the pool or in the recirculation for bacteriological purification. Iron stain in the water is bad in any pool and may completely upset the color scheme in a tile-lined pool of the more decorative type. Before deciding on the tile color, ascertain the color cast of the water and take advantage of it if it cannot be subdued to such an extent that it will not interfere with the desired colors in the tile. In less decorative pools where cement paint is used, this consideration has less weight.
Sanitation is a vital consideration. The simplest method is to keep fresh water running into and out of the pool continuously at a rate to renew the entire volume every second day, combined with occasional emptying and scrubbing. Another method is to empty and refill the pool completely at regular intervals, usually from two to seven days elapsing between renewals. The advisability of either method is governed by the elements of abundance of supply at low cost and intensity and continuity of use of the pool, for it is obvious that much time must be lost in emptying and refilling. Here again, the size of supply pipes and drain pipes must be considered early in the planning. Another consideration in this connection is the lowering of the temperature of the pool water at each renewal. Both of these methods are in use, especially in small private pools, but are seldom practiced in other types.
Questions:
Based on the information provided in the passage, which of the following best describes the author's primary concern when designing a swimming pool? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)

2. Maximizing the speed at which the pool can be filled with water.
3. Balancing practical considerations of water supply with sanitation and user experience. (Correct)
4. Promoting the use of the latest technological advancements in pool construction

1. The size of the pool.
2. The color of the pool tiles.
3. The availability and cost of water supply. (Correct)
4. The temperature of the surrounding air.
The text mentions that iron stains in the water can "completely upset the color scheme in a tile-lined pool of the more decorative type." Together with the information in the passage about water quality, this fact most clearly indicates that: (Reasoning Within the Text,2)
1. Pool designers prioritize aesthetics over water sanitation.
2. The visual appeal of a pool is considered an important factor in its design and maintenance. (Correct)
3. Iron stains are the most significant problem in pool water quality.

Title: Star Stuff - 1
Description: “Sometimes, I stay up at night and think about how we’re all just celestial plankton floating in the cosmic soup, waiting for our sun to turn into a giant lightbulb and fry us all.

Passage:
In his 1980s television series Cosmos, Carl Sagan popularized the idea that we are "star stuff," emphasizing that everything we know is made of matter born in a star. "We are their children," Sagan said, reminding us that our bodies, technologies, and histories all began in a starfire crucible. Consider plants, for example, the "photosynthetic ones," the "sun worshippers and worldly conjurers." Imagine phytoplankton in ancient oceans using solar radiation to increase atmospheric oxygen, making it possible for ancestral life to leave the sea and walk in space-suit-like bodies filled with ocean water. Inhale Earth's atmosphere now and consider the plants, still breathing with us, in our shared biosphere made possible by stars. This interstellar intimacy reminds us we live and die with stars, on a solar-powered world.
I grew up under fields of starlight in high-altitude Eastern Oregon, looking into our galactic heart across star rivers and interstellar dust. Elsewhere, today, light and air pollution block this experience of facing the galaxy, a rite of passage into "hyposubjectivity." Every culture has a night full of stars. What happens without those stars to remind us how much we do not know? Today the Milky Way is hidden from one-third of humanity. The occluding haze of fossil-fueled artificial skyglow is an anthropogenic shadow cast up over the stars, obscuring a reminder of how recently-arrived and short-lived we are in celestial time.
In an unimaginable deep future, billions of years from now, our star-engine Sun will expand and burn the Earth before collapsing into a stellar remnant, slowly dimming into lightless death. A disaster (dis-astron) is "a fallen, dysfunctional, or dangerous, or evil, star." We have always lived with this ineludible disaster, but human temporality rarely takes such futures into account. The eventual stellar Apocalypse (uncovering or disclosing) unveils hope through photosynthetic lessons from star-worshiping plants who teach us to clear the haze and reveal the night sky by following their solar-powered example. The interstellar doesn’t promise forever, but asks: How do you want to spend this time until I return to you, and you return to me?
If the interstellar is "the space between the stars," our planetary milieu is likewise increasingly situated between centers as we orbit our Sun while reaching out to other suns, each a star at the center of a solar system. Such interstellar perspectives amplify an ever-expanding "environmental solar system" so that our home becomes "as much cosmic as it is human," at once "dreamy and rational, earthly and celestial."
Consider the following scientific story of Earth's trajectory. We are shielded from our star by a planetary magnetic force field. Enormous hyperobjects, non-human entities massively distributed in time and space, collide as solar wind and magnetosphere frictions ignite aurora fires in our skies. Now, imagine our entire solar system enveloped within another hyperobject, the heliosphere, an even larger magnetic bubble pushing back against the interstellar winds just as Earth's magnetic field repels the solar wind. Our solar system is also in motion, circling the center of the Milky Way which is, in turn, an unimaginable vastness within a filament of galactic super-clusters, surging along cosmic rivers of gravitational flow. Traced as a line, tracking our orbit around the sun, around the galaxy, and so on, this motion is not a circle or ellipse. Our course spirals, warps, and soars across multiple vectors. The interstellar perspective disrupts assumed trajectories of Earth's path through the universe.
We are already traveling across the space between the stars, already living on a world ship. If we think of our interstellar journey as a meshwork of lines and trajectories, what courses might our future travels trace, what might we carry to other worlds, on which wayfaring paths?
Questions:
The primary purpose of this passage is to: (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. explain the scientific process of star formation.
2. worship the massive and unknowable universe.  
3. criticize society's disconnection from the stars.
4. ponder the connection between life and stars. (Correct)

1. Plants are superior to humans in their connection to the stars.
2. Plants and humans are separate but equal parts of the cosmic cycle. 
3. Plants are teachers that can guide humanity's understanding of our stellar origins. (Correct)
4. Plants and humans are competing for the same cosmic resources.


Suppose Isaac Asimov in his 1951 book “Foundation” wrote about the idea that we are “star stuff. How does this affect the claim that Carl Sagan popularized the idea? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,1)
1. It would refute the claim that Sagan popularized the idea, as Asimov introduced it much earlier.
2. It would support the claim that Sagan popularized the idea, if Asimov’s books weren’t widely read.
3. It would challenge the claim that Sagan popularized the idea, if Asimov’s books were widely sold and the term previously used in popular culture. (Correct)
4. It would support the claim that Sagan popularized the idea, if it was proven that Asimov originated the term.


What is hinted by the phrase “How do you want to spend this time until I return to you, and you return to me” (paragraph 3)? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. There’s a cyclic relationship between humans and stars. (Correct)
2. Humans failed to take the future into account.
3. Celestial bodies and human life were very similar.
4. Humans need to clear the “occluding haze.”

1. fossil fuels contributing to climate change.
2. barrier between humanity and its cosmic heritage. (Correct)
3. advancement of technology in modern society.
4. interstellar dust blocking stars from view.


Suppose a scientist challenges this passage by saying that celestial bodies have elemental compositions that greatly differ from humans. How would the author reply to this? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. “The origin of our matter is irrelevant to the broader philosophical point about our cosmic connection.”
2. “While the specific elemental compositions may differ, the fundamental building blocks originated in stars.” (Correct)
3. “I’ll include more precise scientific information about elemental compositions.”
4. “Our connection to the cosmos invalidates arguments based on scientific fact.”

1. "We are all in the same boat."
2. "A rising tide lifts all boats."
3. "We are cut from the same cloth." (Correct)
4. "It takes a village to raise a child."

1. weak; there is no explanation given for who the author is quoting.
2. weak; the following paragraph goes on an unrelated tangent.
3. strong; the following paragraph elaborates on this extensively. (Correct)

Passage:
The overarching goal of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is to ban all non-nuclear states from acquiring nuclear weapons and to reduce nuclear weapons worldwide for the five recognized nuclear weapons states (NWS): the U.S., China, Russia, France, and the UK, with a view to completely eliminate nuclear weapons. However, one particular problem with the NPT is that the treaty has not adapted over time to the evolving security concerns in the current global arena. The steps envisaged in the NPT to address nuclear proliferation are ambiguous and not instructive. Two central themes in the NPT are the "strengthening of trust between states" and the "ending of production of any new nuclear weapons" (International Atomic Energy Agency, 1970). While dialogue and diplomacy could aid in state-to-state relations, this only holds if states are willing to engage in an atmosphere of trust—a condition that has historically been elusive.
Countries like North Korea and Iran continue to pursue programs for nuclear weapons capabilities, undermining the NPT's effectiveness. The possibility of nuclear materials or even a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorist groups cannot be easily discounted, given the nature of these regimes. North Korea, for instance, has continued to refine uranium and plutonium in recent years. Since 2006, the intermittently active Pyongsan Uranium Plant has been producing yellow cake for further refinement. Evidence regarding production is visible in the unlined tailings pond at the Pyongsan Uranium Plant, where satellite imagery displays clear indications of steadily accumulating amounts of tailings. The latest 2016 imagery compared to the same in 2006 indicates that the amount of waste in the pond has tripled in size. North Korea seems to be mining more uranium to meet what may be increasing needs for fuel or bombs.
Unfortunately, current non-nuclear proliferation regimes and the global community have had no restraining impact on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions since 2008 when North Korea withdrew from the NPT. A persistent concern is that North Korea may consider selling excess nuclear fuel or devices, and that legacy nuclear weapons remain particularly vulnerable to theft and pilferage. A review of nuclear weapons storage sites worldwide reveals significant security risks, with stockpiles susceptible to theft or seizure by terrorists. In recent years, the threat of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation by non-nuclear states (NNS) has been a matter of serious concern for the international community.
The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) identifies three measures to prevent nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation. The first is the reversal of North Korea’s and Iran’s ambitions in becoming nuclear threats. Part of this initiative was successful in July 2015, with the Iran Nuclear Agreement and the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This agreement marked a positive step toward ensuring that nuclear technology is used exclusively for peaceful means. However, a similar deal with North Korea does not promise an optimistic outcome due to the different issues at play, including the scarcity of food and energy in North Korea, which the regime hides under brinkmanship postures.
The second NPR measure is the acceleration of efforts to "secure all vulnerable nuclear materials worldwide in four years" (NPR, 2010). However, this initiative fails to address security issues at nuclear weapons storage sites in some countries. Over 40 countries have stockpiles of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and weapons-grade plutonium, many of which continue to be security risks. Increased physical security may assist in prohibiting non-state actors and terrorists from stealing nuclear weapons and materials, but more international pressure may be needed to secure at-risk stockpiles, particularly in countries that do not feel threatened by terrorism.
The third NPR provision is focused on preventing nuclear terrorism and NNS from nuclear proliferation through arms control measures such as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. However, the effectiveness of these measures is uncertain as the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty still allows underground testing—a method preferred by North Korea—and the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty has not yet been fully developed.
In summary, further initiatives based on international consensus are needed to deter nuclear terrorism, CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) attacks, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Existing treaties, protocols, and agreements have generally not evolved to meet new and emerging security threats. The threat of nuclear terrorism will continue to exist, especially due to the physical and logistical weaknesses in the management of nuclear weapons stockpiles and storage.

Passage:
In contemporary Japan, a virtual world of anime (Japanese animation), film, and games offers oni and other yōkai unlimited potential. Manga (graphic novels)—a close relative of anime and an essential component in contemporary Japanese pop culture—is also fertile soil for oni. Japanese manga were popular in the pre-war period, but it was only after the war that the industry fully recognized its potential, most notably with the publication of Osamu Tezuka’s (1928–1989) Tetsuwan Atomu (Astro Boy). In 1995, comic books were a billion-dollar industry in Japan, accounting for 40 percent of all books and magazines sold. Overseas as well, a San Francisco-based Japanese manga and anime company that translates Japanese work into the English language was a four- or five-man operation in 1986; by 2007, it had grown to a staff of 130. Many anime are based on stories that appeared first in manga. Indeed, Japan’s first animated television series was the aforementioned Osamu Tezuka’s Astro Boy in 1963.
Susan Napier writes, “anime, with its enormous breadth of subject material, is … a useful mirror on contemporary Japanese society, offering an array of insights into the significant issues, dreams, and nightmares of the day” (Anime 8). In the various array of subject materials, oni and yōkai are important ingredients to help understand the Japanese, as well as the broader human psyche.
As human knowledge of earth expands, and as the world becomes smaller, oni’s trope moves beyond this planet. Perhaps because it is less believable today that oni would inhabit far-distant mountains and rivers in Japan, a contemporary oni in these media is often portrayed as a creature from a different time and/or space. An oni is an alien, a hybrid of earthlings and some different species, or simply a different species on earth from the very long past, the future, or, if from the present, then from a different temporal dimension. An oni’s existence has also become entwined with cutting-edge technologies such as electronics, mechanics, and robotics. In cyberspace, oni often cohabit with humans as urban dwellers. Geopolitics may change; but the oni is still an alienated “other.” Some oni are looking for a companion and others exist as allegories or social commentaries. Just as the subject matters of the contemporary representative pop cultural media vary greatly, the oni’s representation varies widely.
Apocalyptic fiction became quite popular in the late 1960s and 70s as rapid economic growth came to Japan, and with it came pollution and societal anxieties. Even though the Cold War was over and the nuclear threat had receded, various apocalyptic fictions were created with a background of societal intransparency and other disasters facing mankind.
One of the pioneering artists portraying apocalyptic and elegiac modes of manga through the utilization of oni and demonic creatures is Nagai Gō (born 1945). Nagai often depicts oni as members of a different tribe from the mainstream Japanese race or as creatures born out of grudge, enmity, and suffering. For example, the oni in Oni—2889 nen no hanran (Oni—The Rebellion in 2889), which appeared in December 1969, is a synthetic human—a creation of human technology. Similar to “replicants” in the film Blade Runner (1982), the oni are absolutely supposed to obey the humans. But the oni rebel against the humans and their cruel treatment. While the setting is literally futuristic, the core concept of an oni as a marginalized being borne out of grudge, enmity, and suffering remains unchanged.
Questions:
Which of the following challenges Napier’s view of anime (paragraph 2)? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,1)
1. Japanese anthropology classes study anime as well as books.

Passage:
For the past 20 years, there has been lively debate among Foucauldian scholars around the concept of biopolitics and biopower, which under late capitalism seem to have ever greater theoretical application. Very briefly, biopolitics refers to a political rationale that takes the management of populations as its objective. In Michel Foucault’s view, this rationale began developing throughout the 17th and 18th centuries and was fully unleashed in the 19th century in conjunction with modern forms of nationalism and capitalism. Biopower enabled an expansive capitalist system, allowing for “the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to economic processes.” Biopower also helped constitute the modern state as the defender of society, and on that basis justified mass slaughter in wars against other populations and countries.
Building upon Foucault’s insights, scholars such as Giorgio Agamben, Achille Mbembe, Roberto Esposito, and Timothy Campbell have furthered theoretical conversations on biopower and the right of the sovereign state to inflict death in its management of certain populations. For instance, Mbembe draws upon the colony and slave plantations as early sites of capitalism where “necropolitics” was practiced. By necropolitics, he refers to the conditions in which people lived at the mercy of the colonizer/slaveowner in an existence in-between life and death. According to Mbembe: “the ultimate expression of sovereignty resides, to a large degree, in the power and the capacity to dictate who may live and who must die. Hence, to kill or to allow to live constitute the limits of sovereignty, its fundamental attributes. To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mortality and to define life as the deployment and manifestation of power.”
It is important to remember that capitalism and death have always been intimately linked. From its earliest iterations in the 17th and 18th centuries, modern state capitalism is associated with an acceptable loss of human life in the business of making money. Capitalist ventures endorsed by the state, such as the slave trade and gold mining in the New World, are intertwined with horrific histories of brutality and genocide of Africans and Indigenous populations. Today, in the rhetoric of late capitalism, death is often expressed as “collateral damage” or “acceptable risk.” This rationale informs tragic events typically associated with developing nations, such as the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed well over 1,000 young girls and women (due to poor building regulations). But similar “disasters” occur in wealthy industrialized nations as well such as the Grenfell 24-story tower fire in London that killed 72 people in June 2017 (due to cheap combustible external cladding), and the Boeing 737 airplane crashes in October 2018, and March 2019, killing 189 and 157 people respectively (due to inadequately tested software). Whether occurring in the global south or global north, these events reflect executive decision-making that accounted for a certain level of potential death (and punitive fines) as part of a strategy maximizing profit. According to Peter Baker, a government: “makes money-versus-lives trade-offs all the time. When a regulatory agency weighs in a new safety rule, it measures the cost to industry or consumers against the gain by assigning a dollar value to each life that might be saved. If a new rule costs billions of dollars but would only prevent a few dozen deaths, it is likely it would not be adopted—even though someone would die as a result.”
Drawing upon the long histories of exploitative capitalism that include pre-calculated collateral loss of life, there is emerging a theoretical intervention that speaks to the particular economic conditions of the 21st century. An increasing number of social theorists and philosophers are talking about “economies of death” or “necro-economies.” These theories differ from earlier discussions of biopolitics and necropolitics in that in the new necro-economy death itself has become the goal and driver of business.
Questions:
What is the primary purpose of this passage? (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. To trace the historical development of capitalism from the 17th century to the present day.
2. To compare and contrast different theories of biopolitics and necropolitics.
3. To argue that death has always been intertwined with capitalism and is becoming increasingly central to it. (Correct)
4. To criticize modern corporations for their disregard of human life in pursuit of profit.
How does the author primarily present arguments about capitalism throughout the passage? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. Analytically, focusing on theoretical concepts without explicit judgment. 
2. Critically, using historical examples to illustrate negative aspects. (Correct)
3. Thoughtfully, highlighting capitalism's essential role in shaping an ethical society.
4. Ambivalently, balancing positive and negative aspects of capitalist systems.
Based on the passage, how does Mbembe's concept of "necropolitics" extend Foucault's ideas about biopower? (Reasoning Within the Text,1)
1. It shifts the focus from population management to individual control.
2. It contradicts Foucault's theory by emphasizing the slaver’s sovereignty over life.
3. It applies biopolitical concepts exclusively to colonial and slave contexts.
4. It expands biopower to include the sovereignty’s power over life and death. (Correct)
If a pharmaceutical company was found to have knowingly released a highly addictive product, which one of the following consequences is LEAST consistent with the passage arguments? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. The company faces significant fines, which it had already factored into its profit calculations.
2. The government imposes new regulations that balance the cost to the industry against the potential lives saved. 
3. The incident sparks government funding into new drugs that decrease the quantity of lives lost. 
4. The government promotes the companies products as financial gain takes precedence over preserving human life. (Correct)
A new drug for ALS could save a few hundred patients but would cost several billion dollars to effectively roll out. According to the author, a regulatory agency would most likely: (Reasoning Beyond the Text,1)
1. Immediately approve the drug, as saving lives always takes precedence over economic concerns.
2. Reject the drug outright due to its high cost, regardless of its life-saving potential. 
3. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis, weighing the number of lives saved against the financial investment required. (Correct)
4. Defer the decision to pharmaceutical companies, allowing market forces to determine the drug's availability.
According to the passage, the relationship between biopower and necropolitics can best be characterized as: (Reasoning Within the Text,1)
1. contradictory, with biopower focusing on life management and necropolitics on death.
2. complementary, both being aspects of sovereign power over life and death. (Correct)
3. chronological, with necropolitics replacing biopower in modern political theory.
4. irrelevant, as the concepts apply to different historical periods.
In the first paragraph, what does the author's use of the term "Foucauldian” to refer to scholars imply? (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. Foucault's theories are considered outdated in contemporary academic discourse.
2. Only a small, specialized group of academics study Foucault's ideas. 
3. Foucault's theories inspired a significant body of academic work. (Correct)
4. Foucault led a group of devoted followers. 
Which of the following capitalist arguments most directly challenges the author's assertion that the economic system inherently involves a tradeoff between monetary gain and human life? (Reasoning Beyond the Text,2)
1. The focus on "collateral damage" overlooks how capitalist systems have led to overall improvements in global health and well-being.
2. Comparing early colonial capitalism to modern regulated markets ignores the development of ethical business practices and corporate social responsibility.
3. The idea of "necro-economies" fails to recognize that capitalist competition often results in safer products despite the cost-benefit-analysis of monetary gain against human life.
4. Genuine capitalism does not assign a dollar value to human life as there is no supply and demand market applied to it. (Correct)
Which of the following claims made by the author is LEAST supported by specific evidence in the passage? (Reasoning Within the Text,2)
1. "From its earliest iterations in the 17th and 18th centuries, modern state capitalism is associated with an acceptable loss of human life in the business of making money."
2. "Today, in the rhetoric of late capitalism, death is often expressed as 'collateral damage' or 'acceptable risk.'"
3. “Whether occurring in the global south or global north, these events reflect executive decision-making that accounted for a certain level of potential death (and punitive fines) as part of a strategy maximizing profit.”
4. “The new necro-economy death itself has become the goal and driver of business.” (Correct)

Title: New Bohemia - 1
Description: “Ah, hippie fashion. Back then, it was a part of a revolution in thinking. Now-a-days, it just means ‘my dad works at Lockheed Martin while I practice mayonnaise-flavored buddhism.’” 
Citation: Modified by Prynce. Duncan, R. (2013). The summer of love and protest. The Transatlantic Sixties, 144–173. 
Passage:
By 1964, mainstream magazines in New York, and swiftly across the world, described a “New Bohemia” in the Lower East Side of Manhattan where “hipsters” were gathering. Cultural critic Norman Mailer had first used this word in his book The White Negro (1957). By 1965, hipsters had been shortened to “hippies.” Hippies were notably different from the bohemianism of the “Beats” in nearby Greenwich Village who were considered a non-threatening curiosity of brooders. The hippies had much larger numbers and were thought to be far more dangerous a threat to the Establishment, even in their optimistic playfulness. Hippies soon placed the center of the hippie nation in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco, described by historian Gretchen Lemke-Santangelo as “hippie central, a swirling, colorful, all-hours hub of youthful yearning.”
Visually, fashion and longer hair set hippies apart and became signifiers of the counterculture. Hippies seemed rougher, dirtier, hairier, more childlike, and clearly more androgynous than the Beats. Hippies were almost cartoonish, had kinkier sex (an unproven, if popular, assertion), different musical tastes, an expanded taste for drugs, and wore brighter clothes. The Beats preferred the serious intellectualism, and drabness, of black. Hippies loved charade and posing in dance, theater and fashion—a celebration in tune with nature and instinct. Hippies evoked the myth of the American frontier in its cowboy leather, pieced together scraps of fabric, American Indian beadwork, woven, crocheted, and knitted handmades, Vietnam US Army shirts, and long hair. All of this was done in a unisex way. The posturing and sophistication of jazz clubs was replaced by individualist body street performances aligned with rock ’n’ roll. The military uniforms might seem at odds with the hippie ethos, but the idea was to use whatever was available, over-manufactured and abundant—a leveling of everyone from soldiers to hippies, all together now. By the late 1960s, wearing army shirts was also a way to reach out to those eighteen-year-olds drafted into the war by saying clearly: we aren’t against the soldiers; we are against the war. All of this fashion was a move toward naturalism, primitivism, and recyclable anti-materialism. Women wore see-through fabrics, feathers and silks, beads, no bras and, sometimes, no panties. Instead of “conspicuous consumption” there was “conspicuous thrift.”
It is impossible to exaggerate how much hair was on display. There was so much hair! The “Age of Aquarius” rolled along on an ocean of hair and beards, “long beautiful hair, shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen; give me down to there, shoulder length or longer, here baby, there mama everywhere daddy daddy hair. Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair.” Conservatives and the older generation of “perms,” “flat tops,” “buzz cuts,” oil-saturated and combed slickness disliked the implications of long, out-of-order, stringy hair. They wanted males to “look like a man!” and females to “brush your hair!” The gender bending of long hair on both sexes was a clear sign of disorder, anti-capitalist, military draft-dodging, and sexually-liberated leanings. When the musical “Hair” played in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1970, conservatives picketed the theater with signs reading “God Hates Hair” and “God Loves Clothes.”
When the youth culture turned to hippie fashion, it was to the paisley patterns, miniskirts, micro-minis, or maxi skirts, boots, long hair, beads, and brightness. The fashion was both ultra-modern and nostalgic/romantic. When Jacqueline Kennedy pulled on a miniskirt in 1966, women over 30 years old quickly joined in. The hippie fashion revolution of the 1960s represented not just a change in clothing styles, but a broader shift in social values, gender norms, and cultural attitudes that would continue to influence American society for decades to come.
Questions:
What is the focus of the passage? (Foundations of Comprehension,1)
1. The evolution of youth fashion and its impact on cultural values in the 1960s.
2. The comparison between the Beat generation and the hippie movement in terms of lifestyle and fashion.
3. The rise of the hippie movement and its influence on fashion and cultural values in the 1960s. (Correct)
4. The backlash from conservatives against the changing hairstyles of the 1960s youth.

1. support U.S. soldiers.
2. express national unity.
3. convey anti-war messages. (Correct)
4. challenge societal norms.
Based on the passage, why might the hippies’ fashion choices have been considered a threat to the establishment? (Foundations of Comprehension,2)
1. Because their fashion included elements like long hair that challenged the notion of “only two genders.”
2. Because their clothing choices reflected a desire to distance themselves from conventional society.
3. Because their fashion was linked to anti-war and anti-capitalist sentiments. (Correct)
4. Because they adopted a minimalist style similar to that of the Beats, which criticized consumerism.

Title: Dante’s Inferno & Capitalism - 2
Description: “Why did Dante get lost in the middle of the forest? Because he couldn't "circle" back! Get it? Because Dante’s circles? Do you get it? Please tell me you get it.” 


Citation: Karki, Prynce. “Hell As a Warning.” 2023. Passage written for the purposes of MyMCAT. 


Passage:


Dante, exiled from his home city of Florence, wrote and published one of the most seminal political works of all time: The Divine Comedy. Completed in 1314, this epic poem shaped the modern conception of Hell, depicting it as a structured realm where God dispenses suffering according to the weight of an individual's sins, placing souls in one of nine hierarchical circles. While the Commedia did not invent the notion of eternal torment or the vivid imagery of hellfire and demonic torture, it uniquely portrayed Hell as a place of divine order where sins are like vectors, differing in magnitude but sharing a common direction. Transgressions against divine law cause souls to descend into Hell, and the severity of the infraction determines their depth.
Dante's construction of Hell was revolutionary for its time and raises enduring questions about the nature of sin and divine justice, provoking debate among scholars and theologians to this day. Modern notions of morality might place murderers in the lowest circle of Hell, perhaps stratifying them according to the heinousness of their crimes or the number of people they killed. However, in Dante's vision, murder—categorized as violence—confines the sinner to the seventh circle, and only to its first ring. Suicides and usurers (those who engage in excessive money-lending) are placed in the second and third rings of this circle, respectively. In the eighth circle, fraud is punished even more harshly, with a particular disdain for clergymen who sell spiritual favors for personal gain. This ordering suggests that, according to Dante, God despises televangelists more than murderers like Hitler. A curious aspect here is the inclusion of usury as a form of violence. When Dante questions why, his guide Virgil explains that God's will is for humans to "earn their bread and prosper" through their own labor, while an usurer takes "another path" by accumulating excessive wealth through lending.
To grasp the reasoning behind this, one must first understand the hierarchy of Hell. The first five circles contain those who committed sins of lust, gluttony, greed, and wrath. These are considered sins of "incontinence," or a lack of self-restraint, which Virgil argues "offends God less and incurs lesser blame" than the sins found in the lower circles of Hell, which include heresy, violence, fraud, and treachery. Scholars have debated the distinction between wrath and violence, suggesting that wrath is often driven by circumstances, while violence is a conscious choice. However, one could argue that the sixth circle, designated for violence, might also be interpreted as a sin of incontinence.
To illustrate this point, consider a modern example. In the song "Poles 1469," the rapper 6ix9ine states that if someone were to “test him”, he would “put a hole in his head” until  “he a dolphin.” He implies that if his anger were not provoked, he would not commit such an act. If we interpret his violence as stemming from a failure to control his emotional response—a failure of free will—then one might argue he should incur less blame. However, in Dante's moral universe, God is less concerned with human will. The distinction between wrath and violence in Hell is determined at a metaphysical level, rooted in the violation of divine order.
We return now to usury as a form of violence. Usury disrupts God's intended economic system of equivalent exchange. Similarly, when wrath leads to murder, it is viewed as an encroachment upon what is considered God's property. Dante's depiction of Hell appears to revere certain figures—such as tyrants and conquerors—who, despite their sins, are seen as having achieved status through biblical-scale acts of violence, akin to divine retribution, like the flooding of the Earth. In this framework, Hitler's ultimate sin was not merely the act of ordering mass murder but attempting to execute such actions on a scale comparable to God's.
The implications of Dante's moral hierarchy extend beyond literary analysis or theological debate. The sins in the lower circles of Hell manipulate the very fabric of reality as constructed by divine law—truth itself—thrusting humanity beyond its natural capacities and into the realm of the divine. In this sense, Hell is not merely a place of punishment for human failings but a repressive apparatus that stratifies sins based on how severely they disrupt God's order, an order inherently tied to a deterministic and capitalist framework. This stratification reinforces God's authority while instilling a "slave morality" in humans: to overreach into the divine and gain power necessitates a degradation of moral character.

Title: Affordable Care Act - 1
Description: "Buckle up, health wonks! "Affordable Care Act - 1" is a rollercoaster ride through the insurance jungle that'll make your premiums spin. This passage is so dense with policy details, it could insure itself against comprehension gaps. But hey, that's what you're here for, right? Time to diagnose this healthcare beast!"

Passage:
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 with the goal of expanding health insurance coverage and making it more affordable. Now that several years have passed and many key provisions have taken effect, we can begin to evaluate the law's impact and effectiveness.
One of the central promises made about the ACA was that "if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan." However, this has not proven to be the case for many Americans. As of December 2013, roughly 5.4 million Americans with individual policies have had their current insurance policy canceled because it did not meet ACA's requirements. Another 3 to 8 million are expected to lose their policies in the coming months.
The ACA requires that insurance plans meet certain standards for "minimum essential coverage" in order to satisfy the individual mandate. Plans must cover services like maternity care, mental health treatment, and pediatric dental care. While these expanded benefits may be valuable for some, they have resulted in many existing plans being deemed noncompliant.
Even plans that were initially grandfathered in are losing that status as they make routine changes over time. The Obama administration estimated that 40-67% of individual plans would lose their grandfathered status by the end of 2013. For employer-sponsored plans, 49-80% were expected to lose grandfathered status.
Beyond losing their current plans, many Americans are also finding it difficult to keep their preferred doctors under new ACA-compliant insurance policies. Insurance companies have been narrowing their provider networks in an effort to control costs. According to a survey by the Medical Group Management Association, nearly 40% of doctors are uncertain about whether they will be included in networks of plans being sold through the ACA exchanges.
In terms of affordability, the impact of the ACA has been mixed. Some Americans, particularly older and sicker individuals, are seeing their premiums go down. However, many others, especially younger and healthier people, are facing significant premium increases. A study by the Manhattan Institute found that underlying premium increases averaged 41% nationwide.
The law is also falling short of expectations when it comes to expanding coverage. While millions of previously uninsured Americans have gained coverage, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 31 million people will still be uninsured by 2023. This is far higher than initial projections.
The economic impact of the ACA has also been controversial. Many businesses report that they are reducing employee hours or limiting hiring in order to stay under the 50 full-time employee threshold that triggers the employer mandate. A Gallup poll found that 41% of small business owners said they have already held off on plans to hire new employees due to the ACA.
Supporters of the law argue that by reducing "job lock" and providing subsidies, the ACA will increase entrepreneurship and labor market flexibility. However, the CBO estimates that the law will reduce the total number of hours worked by about 1.5-2% in 2017-2024, which is equivalent to about 2 million fewer full-time workers.
In evaluating the overall impact of the Affordable Care Act, it's clear that the reality has diverged significantly from the promises and projections made when the law was passed. While expanding access to health insurance, it has disrupted existing insurance arrangements, increased costs for many, and created new economic distortions. As implementation continues, policymakers will need to grapple with these unintended consequences and shortcomings of this ambitious health care reform
