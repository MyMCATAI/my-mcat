1,Two Star,2,"I felt more like a feather on the wind than a majestic bird during my visit, as the lack of proper perches and spacious aviary vibes definitely left me feeling a bit trapped. Kalypso was friendly, but $NAME seemed a tad unprepared for an eagle encounter.

1,Two Star,2,"The staff are friendly but I couldn’t flap my wings without tripping over a bucket; seriously, $NAME needs to up their game if they want to soar! – Ace the Aeronautical Avian"
1,Two Star,2,"When I was offered a perch in the waiting room with a rather unfortunate view of a janitor's closet, I couldn’t help but feel my wings droop a little—Kalypso was lovely, but I think my pal $NAME needs to hit the books before trying to diagnose my appetite for adventure. 

- Whimsical Wendy the Hawk ⭐⭐"
1,Two Star,2,"The staff was friendly, but the facility felt more like a tree branch and less like a tree palace — I expected a bit more comfort for an all-star like me, despite Kalypso's sparkling personality; $NAME could use some serious shadowing before they take a crack at this whole animal care thing. 

Hootington the Owl"
1,Two Star,2,"The brightly colored walls and cheerful decorations were lovely, but I was still left a bit ruffled by the limited toys and heavy focus on squawking instructions, instead of a more feather-friendly environment for us beaks; at least Kalypso showed a flicker of understanding while $NAME seemed to need a bit more practice with patience. - Polly's Ponderous Perch"
1,Two Star,2,"While the vibrant colors of my feathers dazzled the day, the lack of proper perches and the somewhat clumsy handling left me feeling a bit ruffled; Kalypso, bless their heart, did try, but I hope $NAME can refine their skills before stepping into such a colorful world.

1,Two Star,2,"I flapped around the waiting room and wondered why I had to keep pecking at the same pile of bland seeds – a little more variety in snacks wouldn’t hurt, you know! Kalypso had a delightful aura, but I could see that $NAME was still learning the ropes, so I hope they get it together because they could potentially spread their wings someday. 

- Sassafras the Raven"
1,Two Star,2,"I may be hopping mad about the unkempt litter box situation, but Kalypso surely knows his stuff—though, $NAME, sweetie, maybe try to use the big-kid tools next time. 

- Binky the Disgruntled Bunny ★★"
1,Two Star,2,"Despite my rather colorful beak not getting the spotlight it deserves, I must admit the staff here have a charm about them, though I did find the clinic suspiciously lacking in proper branches for perching comfort. 

- Tilly the Toucan  
☆☆"

1,Two Star,2,"I appreciate that they let me bark my opinions loud and clear, but I'm pretty sure the place could use a few more fish tanks and comfy napping spots.

1,One Star,1,"I waddled in with a sense of wonder, but it quickly was replaced by confusion as I realized these humans didn’t even have a proper dance floor for my twirling! Kalypso tried his best, but the intern, $NAME, couldn’t even keep up with my rhythm. - Twinkle Toes the Flamingo ✨"
1,One Star,1,"I felt like I was swinging from branch to branch in a storm while waiting for my treatment, and let’s just say, the only thing “professional” about my care was the name on the door! - Tilly the Toucan"
1,One Star,1,"I must say, getting treated at this clinic felt a bit like being auditioned for a reality show—lots of flash and not much finesse, especially with the way $NAME handled my feathers! - Rumble the Raven ⭐️"

- Benny Beak"
1,One Star,1,"If I could give a meow of disappointment, I'd have to say $NAME’s skills were less “purrs” and more “yowls”— I might have felt better if they hadn’t taken my snack break to try out their ""qualifications."" - Luna the Ocelot"
1,One Star,1,"I came in with high hopes but left thinking maybe they should have just let me run in circles in the snow instead; Kalypso was nice and all, but $NAME’s only solution seemed to involve a really questionable amount of glitter.

1,Zero Star,0,"I hopped in expecting carrot cake and got a check-up that my friends in the wild could’ve handled better—$NAME should really consider some extra schooling before operating on rascally rabbits like me!  
- Thumper the Sarcastic Rabbit"
1,Zero Star,0,"As a bird with big dreams, I expected more from my check-up than leaving with my feathers ruffled and a parakeet-sized brochure when all I got was a hitch in my beak from the rookie intern, who presumably uses a fruit salad as a stethoscope instead of the proper gear. - Tootsie the Ambitious Toucan ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
