CS1P1 - 1,CARs,CARs,Popular Culture,Foundations of Comprehension,1,1,1,,"Over the fall of 2010, rapper Kanye West reimagined the way music was distributed by engaging in an online conversation with millions. For most of that year, Kanye West was firmly present on the cultural radar. This was deliberate and made his presence, performances, and music an ongoing conversation with his fans, his past, and a larger network of engaged online participants. By demonstrating the affordances of participatory culture, West presents a framework for engagement and communication that critical educators can leverage even within the increasingly restrictive space of public education.
Though the capitalist practices that led to his album spending more than six months on the Billboard 200 may not seem like the obvious place to search for liberatory educational pedagogy, I argue that the strategies developed and tested by West offer an important framework for guiding critical consciousness and fomenting action within our classrooms.
As a Hip Hop fan and former music journalist, I often infused my classroom with beats and rhymes. Whether it was the first Lupe Fiasco album encouraging my students to consider the blend between Hip Hop and skateboarder social groups on my campus or formally utilizing classics like Grandmaster Flash’s “The Message” and Dead Prez’s “Police State” as starting points for literary and critical analysis, Hip Hop played a formative part in my teaching practice. For the eight years that I spent teaching English and ELL courses at a public school in South Central Los Angeles, my classroom breathed Hip Hop as well as music across genres to speak to the diverse youth population I worked with. Approximately 80% of my students identified as Latino and 19% as Black, and the school had a dropout rate that rocketed above 60%. Despite being characterized in the media by stereotypes of a failing school, my students exuded a passion to learn that showed me optimism in transforming schools.
Throughout this teaching time, I can see now how Kanye West’s music acted as a through line in my classroom. On a year-round schedule, my first year teaching allowed me to bring in West’s infamous 2005 declaration that “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people” during a Hurricane Katrina relief telethon. Meanwhile, West’s singles filtered into my classroom as music played by students or analyzed for various writing assignments. At the time that West revolutionized media distribution and opportunities for pedagogical growth in 2010, I was working with ninth-grade students and exploring how mobile devices like iPods could help connect urban youth with civically engaging movements beyond the classroom.
Just in time to be critically heralded by music publications ranging from XXL to Rolling Stone, Kanye West's fifth solo album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, was released in the United States on November 22, 2010. However, even by the time the album leaked through file-sharing networks and torrents online, weeks before the official release date, its music was anything but surprising. Via his own music label, G.O.O.D. (Getting Out Our Dreams), West leaked many of the tracks from his album as free downloads during the fall. A matter of a few clicks from his official website yielded more than snippets from the album. Releasing one song each week on “G.O.O.D. Fridays” and responding to challenges and criticism from fans via Twitter, West sustained interest and anticipation throughout the world. In addition to a slew of tracks from the album, including the lead single ""Power,"" West released numerous tracks that were subsequently never officially included in the final album. Speculation about what would make the cut drove buzz around My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy rather than speculation about what kind of sound the album would take. By the end of 2010, West had given away fifteen different tracks, including two of the lead singles from his album: a remix of “Power” and the cameo-filled “Monster.” Through the use of simple and public media tools like Twitter, West moved popular hip-hop models of marketing beyond traditional mixtape culture and illustrated how participatory culture can help foment profit as well as awareness and social organization.","Garcia, Antero. “Beautiful Dark Twisted Pedagogy: Kanye West and the Lessons of Participatory Culture.” The Radical Teacher, no. 97 (2013): 30–35. https://www.jstor.org/stable/48694407.",The author uses Hip-Hop as a starting point for literary and critical analysis to:,protest traditional methods of educational engagement,adhere to state guidelines regarding a literary canon,align with the cultural background of his students,avoid the complex social and political themes of literature,c,CS1P1

Can such a proposition of human–animal identity be proposed in a way in which radical difference is not elided? Would this require the death of both the ‘human’ and the ‘animal’? Such a death would seem a constructive creation. That is, a proposal of Transpecies identity where ‘Other’ ceases to be the operative word: for it is always ‘other to what?’ Such politics are notoriously difficult, and perhaps it is enough that animal–human subcultures push at the boundaries of the human, of normative subjectivity.
Central to this ‘pushing’ for Otherkin are concepts of spirit and soul. This accords a reanimation of spirituality in the public sphere that knits together religion, art and media creations and personal experience that questions both the role of the animal in religion and the individual relation to an eclectic world. Such developments require rethinking both the personal and political role of contemporary religious belief. Accompanying this are questions as to what type of metaphysical and/or ontological ‘grounds’ these subjectivities are built upon. Discourses of presence–absence would seem to sit uneasily underneath such heterodox selves.
And then there is the issue of the singular: surely the ethical endeavour requires seeing/meeting the individual, not the ‘animal’ universal, generic or plural. This link of looking and alterity is made apparent in Haraway’s discussion of the etymology and definition of the term species:
“Rooted in specere, ‘to look’ and ‘to behold’, species takes us to the image impressed on a wax tablet. To the idea impressed on a receptive mind, and to the sovereign stamped on metal coins. Referring both to the relentlessly specific or particular and to a class of individuals with the same characteristics, species contains its own opposite in the most promising – or special – way. Species means radical difference as well as logical, classificatory kind. (2008, xxiii)”

Here is a productive recognition of limit – this limit is also potentiality. This is simultaneously the death of the animal and the death of the human as well as their re-birth as an elusive limit. Although it has been noted herein that Therianthrope subjectivity can be read as employing a universal concept of the animal that does not ethically take into account radical difference (an alterity not premised upon the human or dimorphic concepts of gender), it is equally evident that the questioning of the human and of normative identity categories that the subculture embraces is valuable. It is a more complex, creative and respectful approach to subject identity than that which is currently found in normative anthropocentric discourses of the human. To consider oneself inherently and ontologically betwixt and between species is perhaps not so much pathological as political.
At first glance, Otherkin may seem a faddish, perhaps even quaint or fashionable subculture. However, rather than simply dismiss or ridicule the subcultures, what is argued herein is that these individuals' relationships and their critique of the human can offer potentially useful renegotiations of the concept of subjectivity and how relations with radical difference (alterity) are lived.

Can such a proposition of human–animal identity be proposed in a way in which radical difference is not elided? Would this require the death of both the ‘human’ and the ‘animal’? Such a death would seem a constructive creation. That is, a proposal of Transpecies identity where ‘Other’ ceases to be the operative word: for it is always ‘other to what?’ Such politics are notoriously difficult, and perhaps it is enough that animal–human subcultures push at the boundaries of the human, of normative subjectivity.
Central to this ‘pushing’ for Otherkin are concepts of spirit and soul. This accords a reanimation of spirituality in the public sphere that knits together religion, art and media creations and personal experience that questions both the role of the animal in religion and the individual relation to an eclectic world.

And then there is the issue of the singular: surely the ethical endeavour requires seeing/meeting the individual, not the ‘animal’ universal, generic or plural. This link of looking and alterity is made apparent in Haraway’s discussion of the etymology and definition of the term species:
“Rooted in specere, ‘to look’ and ‘to behold’, species takes us to the image impressed on a wax tablet. To the idea impressed on a receptive mind, and to the sovereign stamped on metal coins. Referring both to the relentlessly specific or particular and to a class of individuals with the same characteristics, species contains its own opposite in the most promising – or special – way. Species means radical difference as well as logical, classificatory kind. (2008, xxiii)”
Both meeting species and/or understanding one’s identity as Transpecies or as Otherkin do therefore require a certain vision, a response-ability and a continual questioning: How does one enter into ethical relations with the animal-other: that one is and yet is not? For what does this gaze call?

Drawing particularly on motifs of destruction and decay, the visual aesthetics of emptiness have given a new meaning to empty cities, which has also led to an increase in representations of ruins, for example in photography and exhibitions.
The industrial city of Detroit and its economic decline have, for instance, become an active canvas for artists on which they inscribe and visualize what has been described as ""America’s most epic urban failure,"" with the city coming ""to stand for nothing so much as its own emptiness and vulnerability."" Empty spaces, then, not only document the city’s painful decline but also mirror what Camilo Vergara has called an ""eerie emptiness."" In the context of urban spaces, emptiness is a familiar and recurring motif. Exploring the dynamics of anxiety and sublime beauty that are associated with places of ruin, she argued that post-apocalyptic narratives also ""render our own society as other and encourage us to ask whether the empire of capital represents lasting progress or a road to decline.""
If emptiness has come to be associated with feelings of anxiety or failure and has at the same time become a familiar sight – for example, in the form of empty high streets or abandoned houses – it seems plausible to suggest that images of a post-apocalyptic setting are already ""inscribed"" in contemporary discourses of emptiness.

Fictional accounts of the apocalypse can also work as reminders that what is presented as a feature of a future society is already an established fact of its extra-textual reality and already present in the form of accepted beliefs and ideologies.
While there is a group dynamic present in many post-apocalyptic narratives, not only does the absence of familiar sights and sounds increase the feeling of unease, but the new spatiality also challenges seemingly natural everyday practices, such as communication between individuals.

Dio claimed that Nero’s reasoning for marrying Sporus was his likeness to Poppaea Sabina, whom he began to miss dearly after he killed her. Nero forced him to wear the jewelry and clothing of an imperial woman, and engaged in open, uncomfortable, public displays of affection with Sporus. The nature of this relationship is traditionally thought to be fueled by lust and sexual violence, in accordance with the pattern Nero displayed with his other sexual partners; however, a recent theory has offered a different interpretation.
David Woods provided this new interpretation in his 2009 article Nero and Sporus, where he suggested that Nero and Sporus’ relationship was not about lust, but rather Nero humiliating an opponent to the throne. Woods suggested that Sporus’ appearance being similar to Poppaea would be interpreted by Nero as Sporus being a descendent of Poppaea; therefore, Sporus may have had imperialistic ties. Woods asserted that this explained Nero’s decision to have Sporus castrated and turned into a woman—to humiliate and prevent him from ascending to Emperor. Woods attempted to back his claim by providing three key pieces of evidence. The first is that Nero had previously used sexual violence as a way to assert his dominance over those he felt threatened by. Woods found that the two best examples of this are when Nero sexually assaulted both Britannicus and Aulus Plautus before he murdered them. Woods explained that he let Sporus live longer to prolong humiliation and because Sporus ultimately was not as big of a threat as the other two had been to his throne. He argued that Nero likely had plans to kill Sporus eventually.
Woods’ second argument was that Nero had Sporus castrated; Woods claimed that this proved Nero was concerned about Sporus’ lineage and wanted to prevent Sporus from having heirs. Woods’ third piece of evidence was that Nero’s successors desired to keep Sporus for themselves, despite not being perceived to desire him sexually. Woods said this proved Sporus’ lineage, as Nero’s successors merely wanted to keep an eye on him. Woods concluded that the nature of this relationship between Nero and Sporus was undeniably riddled with sexual violence and humiliation, but at its core, this relationship was much less about lust than historians originally thought: “In conclusion, the marriage of Nero and Sporus had nothing to do with love…It had been intended simply to humiliate a potential rival for the throne through the use of sexual violence against him.”
In 2014 Michael Charles reviewed Woods’ work in an article titled “Nero and Sporus Again”, where he described Woods’ theory as “entirely novel”.

Charles began by pointing out that Sporus had been a slave, and no matter how much he resembled Poppaea, Nero would not have been threatened in any way by his lineage. Woods’ theory was heavily flawed in its contention that Nero would not have just killed Sporus if he was a threat to his throne; Charles explained that what we know of Nero’s behavior gave the opposite of that impression. He further explained that if there was genuine concern about Sporus’ lineage, at the very least, Nero’s successors would have had him killed. For Woods’ theory to work regarding Nero’s successors, Sporus’ potential lineage would have been common knowledge, and yet, there was no mention of it by the ancient writers. Woods failed to consider what the ancient authors did report; specifically, Dio’s claim that Nero had Sporus castrated in an attempt to turn him into a woman because he simply missed Poppaea.

The nature of this relationship is traditionally thought to be fueled by lust and sexual violence, in accordance with the pattern Nero displayed with his other sexual partners; however, a recent theory has offered a different interpretation.
David Woods provided this new interpretation in his 2009 article Nero and Sporus, where he suggested that Nero and Sporus’ relationship was not about lust, but rather Nero humiliating an opponent to the throne. Woods suggested that Sporus’ appearance being similar to Poppaea would be interpreted by Nero as Sporus being a descendent of Poppaea; therefore, Sporus may have had imperialistic ties. Woods asserted that this explained Nero’s decision to have Sporus castrated and turned into a woman—to humiliate and prevent him from ascending to Emperor. Woods attempted to back his claim by providing three key pieces of evidence. The first is that Nero had previously used sexual violence as a way to assert his dominance over those he felt threatened by. Woods found that the two best examples of this are when Nero sexually assaulted both Britannicus and Aulus Plautus before he murdered them. Woods explained that he let Sporus live longer to prolong humiliation and because Sporus ultimately was not as big of a threat as the other two had been to his throne. He argued that Nero likely had plans to kill Sporus eventually.
Woods’ second argument was that Nero had Sporus castrated; Woods claimed that this proved Nero was concerned about Sporus’ lineage and wanted to prevent Sporus from having heirs. Woods’ third piece of evidence was that Nero’s successors desired to keep Sporus for themselves, despite not being perceived to desire him sexually. Woods said this proved Sporus’ lineage, as Nero’s successors merely wanted to keep an eye on him. Woods concluded that the nature of this relationship between Nero and Sporus was undeniably riddled with sexual violence and humiliation, but at its core, this relationship was much less about lust than historians originally thought: “In conclusion, the marriage of Nero and Sporus had nothing to do with love…It had been intended simply to humiliate a potential rival for the throne through the use of sexual violence against him.”
In 2014 Michael Charles reviewed Woods’ work in an article titled “Nero and Sporus Again”, where he described Woods’ theory as “entirely novel”. Charles stated that Woods’ theory rests too much on extreme speculation and slowly unraveled each of Woods’ key three arguments. Charles began by pointing out that Sporus had been a slave, and no matter how much he resembled Poppaea, Nero would not have been threatened in any way by his lineage. Woods’ theory was heavily flawed in its contention that Nero would not have just killed Sporus if he was a threat to his throne; Charles explained that what we know of Nero’s behavior gave the opposite of that impression. He further explained that if there was genuine concern about Sporus’ lineage, at the very least, Nero’s successors would have had him killed. For Woods’ theory to work regarding Nero’s successors, Sporus’ potential lineage would have been common knowledge, and yet, there was no mention of it by the ancient writers. Woods failed to consider what the ancient authors did report; specifically, Dio’s claim that Nero had Sporus castrated in an attempt to turn him into a woman because he simply missed Poppaea. Charles concluded that due to the uncertainties at the very core of Woods’ theory, it can be given no credibility.","Dean, Zoie A.

CS2P3 - 1,CARs,CARs,Science,Reasoning Beyond the Text,1,2,3,,"Machine learning does not represent an increase in artificial general intelligence that could substitute machines for all aspects of human cognition but rather focuses on one particular aspect of intelligence: prediction. Prediction, in the statistical sense, uses existing data to fill in missing information. As deep-learning pioneer Geoffrey Hinton said, “Take any old problem where you have to predict something and you have a lot of data, and deep learning is probably going to make it work better than the existing techniques.”
Prediction is useful because it is an input into decision-making. Each prediction task is a perfect complement to a decision task, specifying the confidence of a probability associated with an outcome under conditions of uncertainty. Effective decision-making also requires data collection, organization, action based on the decision, and the judgment to evaluate the payoffs associated with different outcomes.
We examine four direct effects through which advances in prediction technology may affect labor in a task-based framework:
1. Substituting capital for labor in prediction tasks.
2. Automating decision tasks when automating prediction increases the relative returns to capital versus labor.
3. Enhancing labor when automating the prediction task increases labor productivity in related decision tasks.
4. Creating new decision tasks when automating prediction sufficiently reduces uncertainty to enable new decisions.
First, artificial intelligence may directly substitute capital for labor in prediction tasks. Some tasks, like demand forecasting, are already prediction tasks. Where humans currently perform these tasks, they are increasingly replaced by artificial intelligence. Other tasks not historically viewed as prediction tasks are being transformed into prediction-oriented tasks as machine learning improves and the quality-adjusted cost of prediction decreases. For example, recruiting in human resources involves predicting which applicants will perform best in the job based on resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and interview transcripts.
Second, when automated prediction can increase the relative returns to capital versus labor in complementary decision tasks, it can lead to the complete automation of a complementary decision task. For instance, machine reaction times are faster than human reaction times. The returns to a machine predicting a potential car accident a few seconds before a human would predict it are higher when the response time of the machine is faster. Thus, automating the prediction task increases the returns to automating certain decision tasks associated with vehicle control.
Third, automating the prediction task may increase the productivity of labor in some cases. For example, ODS Medical developed a device that uses artificial intelligence to predict whether an area of brain tissue has cancer cells during surgery. This enables surgeons to make more precise decisions, reducing the removal of noncancerous tissue and ensuring all cancerous tissue is removed. The device augments the labor of brain surgeons, allowing them to make more nuanced and improved choices.
The fourth type of direct impact of artificial intelligence on labor happens when automated prediction sufficiently reduces uncertainty to enable new decision tasks that did not exist before. Depending on the relative costs of labor and capital, these new tasks can be performed by either. Some tasks that are not economically viable when uncertainty is high become viable as prediction technology reduces uncertainty. This aligns with the reinstatement force, where automation increases the returns to technologies that use labor for new tasks.
The interaction of these four forces determines the net direct effect of cheaper quality-adjusted predictions on labor demand. There are also indirect effects: as some tasks become more efficient, demand for upstream and downstream tasks might change. For example, automating translation on an online trading platform enhances international trade, affecting the labor involved upstream and downstream on both sides of the trade.","Agrawal, Ajay, Joshua S.

CS3P1 - 1,CARs,CARs,Science,Foundations of Comprehension,1,3,1,,"In 1923, the famed genetics professor J.B.S. Haldane, demonstrating a penchant for provocation and prophecy, gave a talk on the future of science. He claimed that scientific research would flourish in the years to come and that he would make no prophecies rasher than those made by H.G. Wells in his works. One very important aspect of science, to Haldane, had been left out of Wells’s imagination due to the shifting scientific interests of different times: the development of the biological sciences. Physics and chemistry, with their 'scientific ideas [...] of flying and radiotelegraphy,' were, by 1923, merely 'commercial problems,' whereas, he believed, the future 'center of scientific interest [lay] in biology.' Some of his prophecies were radical but proved quite accurate. Haldane was the first to foresee the necessary shift in energy production, from coal and oil to wind and sunlight, and proposed hydrogen-powered machinery. Regarding biology, his claims were the most outrageous and garnered the strongest opposition at the time. In a science-fictional essay, supposedly to be read by an undergraduate student of Cambridge University in 2073, on the development of biology in the twentieth century, he claimed, among other things, the birth of the first test-tube baby and genetic selection. His account was rather optimistic, both in terms of time frame (positing 1951 as the birth date of the first child by in vitro fertilization, whereas in reality, it took until 1977) and in terms of its potential to alter the species and offer 'great possibilities in the way of the direct improvement of the individual.'
What is even more interesting than his claim about the importance of biological scientific progress, genetics in particular, is his claim that the inevitable human reaction towards it is repulsion. Drawing on the Greek mythological figures of Prometheus and Daedalus, Haldane argues that the chemical or physical inventor is always a Prometheus. There is no great invention, from fire to flying, which has not been hailed as an insult to some god. But if every physical and chemical invention is a blasphemy, every biological invention is a perversion. There is hardly one which would not appear as indecent and unnatural. Whereas Prometheus would be subject to the revenge of the gods, Daedalus—for his biological creation of the Minotaur—would go unpunished by Zeus and Poseidon. Instead, Haldane claims, the biologist is faced with 'the universal and agelong reprobation of a humanity to whom biological inventions are abhorrent.' The physicist threatens divine power to claim it for humanity, becoming in stature a god himself (or a titan, as Prometheus), and by his creation, in effect, granting humanity its superior status. In contrast, the biologist (especially the geneticist) threatens humanity, robbing it of its natural place, and is thus seen as a threat to and corruption of the human claim to godliness. Prometheus stole fire from the gods, bringing the light of progress to humanity and securing for himself a token position in the mythology of humankind. However, Daedalus’s inventions served as warnings that technology never quite turned out for the good and always demanded a price that was too high to pay—the youths of Athens sacrificed to the Minotaur.
The Prometheus myth carries with it the utopian vision of a better future for humanity—fire, light, and technological progress facilitate this change and allow for a utopian view of what is to come. The hero himself might be punished by the gods, but his deed allowed for humanity to grow and become stronger. The myth of Daedalus is born of a similar utopian vision—his inventions are ingenious and tell of humanity’s potential for technological progress. However, the tables are turned when it comes to the repercussions. When Daedalus builds a device for the cursed queen of Crete, Pasiphae, which allows her to be mounted by the Minoan bull, and thus in effect helps birth the first xenogenetic creation, the Minotaur, it is not he that is punished but humankind. Because the Minotaur is an unnatural creation, its abhorrent nature shows in its diet of human flesh. From the bull that was supposed to be sacrificed springs forth a monster, to which humans must regularly be sacrificed to keep it appeased. Unwittingly, Daedalus had punished humanity for his unnatural creation by not considering the long-term effects of what he had invented.

His account was rather optimistic, both in terms of time frame (positing 1951 as the birth date of the first child by in vitro fertilization, whereas in reality, it took until 1977) and in terms of its potential to alter the species and offer 'great possibilities in the way of the direct improvement of the individual.'
What is even more interesting than his claim about the importance of biological scientific progress, genetics in particular, is his claim that the inevitable human reaction towards it is repulsion. Drawing on the Greek mythological figures of Prometheus and Daedalus, Haldane argues that the chemical or physical inventor is always a Prometheus. There is no great invention, from fire to flying, which has not been hailed as an insult to some god. But if every physical and chemical invention is a blasphemy, every biological invention is a perversion. There is hardly one which would not appear as indecent and unnatural. Whereas Prometheus would be subject to the revenge of the gods, Daedalus—for his biological creation of the Minotaur—would go unpunished by Zeus and Poseidon. Instead, Haldane claims, the biologist is faced with 'the universal and agelong reprobation of a humanity to whom biological inventions are abhorrent.' The physicist threatens divine power to claim it for humanity, becoming in stature a god himself (or a titan, as Prometheus), and by his creation, in effect, granting humanity its superior status. In contrast, the biologist (especially the geneticist) threatens humanity, robbing it of its natural place, and is thus seen as a threat to and corruption of the human claim to godliness. Prometheus stole fire from the gods, bringing the light of progress to humanity and securing for himself a token position in the mythology of humankind. However, Daedalus’s inventions served as warnings that technology never quite turned out for the good and always demanded a price that was too high to pay—the youths of Athens sacrificed to the Minotaur.
The Prometheus myth carries with it the utopian vision of a better future for humanity—fire, light, and technological progress facilitate this change and allow for a utopian view of what is to come. The hero himself might be punished by the gods, but his deed allowed for humanity to grow and become stronger. The myth of Daedalus is born of a similar utopian vision—his inventions are ingenious and tell of humanity’s potential for technological progress. However, the tables are turned when it comes to the repercussions. When Daedalus builds a device for the cursed queen of Crete, Pasiphae, which allows her to be mounted by the Minoan bull, and thus in effect helps birth the first xenogenetic creation, the Minotaur, it is not he that is punished but humankind. Because the Minotaur is an unnatural creation, its abhorrent nature shows in its diet of human flesh. From the bull that was supposed to be sacrificed springs forth a monster, to which humans must regularly be sacrificed to keep it appeased. Unwittingly, Daedalus had punished humanity for his unnatural creation by not considering the long-term effects of what he had invented. His tale, as utopian in vision as it might be, rather shows a dystopian stance towards social and technological progress—it is a cautionary tale.

CS3P2 - 1,CARs,CARs,Ethics,Reasoning Beyond the Text,1,3,2,,"Sommers and Rosenberg (2003) make a strong case that materialistic Darwinism leads to nihilism. They define three philosophical alternatives: naturalism, nihilism, and intuitionism. That is, there are three options:
1. Values exist and they are derived from natural systems (naturalism);
2. Values do not exist and are illusionary (nihilism); or
3. Values exist and are derived from an intuition about a metaphysical reality (intuitionism).
To Sommers and Rosenberg, intuitionism is the idea that we can know things about objective reality using non-empirical means and would include all types of theism. For naturalists, intuitionism must be rejected because it completely undermines materialism and Darwinism. That is, if we can know things about objective reality without empiricism, then the entire enterprise of science falls apart. If we can intuit that man was created by God 6000 years ago, and if that intuition is as valid as the fossil record, then science is useless. Thus, a secular materialist must reject intuitionism. To the materialist, empiricism is the only valid epistemology for understanding the universe.
The rejection of intuitionism for the materialist leaves either naturalism or nihilism. Sommers and Rosenberg define naturalism as combining three theses: a) Normative terms that name intrinsic values and categorical obligations denote real properties of things or acts. b) There are true or well-justified synthetic propositions about which items or actions instantiate these properties. c) There exists a set of scientifically accessible natural facts about us or the world that can justify (a) and explain the truth or well-groundedness of (b).
Darwinian naturalism is the further claim that the theory of natural selection is the set of scientifically accessible facts referred to in thesis (c). Sommers and Rosenberg argue that all naturalists must be Darwinian naturalists because “ethical beliefs...guide conduct that makes a difference for survival and reproduction...Naturalists are committed to the thesis that if there are ethical truths, it must have been adaptive to believe them” (659). In other words, due to the explanatory power of natural selection in animal and human behavior, Darwinian naturalism is the only variety of defensible naturalism—there is no other set of scientifically accessible natural facts about the world that can explain theses (a) and (b) above.
But, to Sommers and Rosenberg, Darwinian naturalism is oxymoronic. The core of Darwinism is that it is a value-neutral process. The results of the process of evolution by natural selection are neither good nor bad, nor are they teleological. Thus, Darwinism cannot justify the existence of normative terms that name intrinsic values and categorical obligations. For example, group selection can lead to altruistic behavior (Trivers 1971) and it can even lead us to laud altruistic behavior because it is in our own adaptive self-interest, but it has no means to impart altruism with objective good. As Sommers and Rosenberg argue, “If all apparently purposive processes, states, events, and conditions are in reality the operation of a purely mechanical substrate-neutral algorithm, then as far as explanatory tasks go, the only values we need to attribute to biological systems are instrumental ones. An evolutionary account of moral belief will not only explain ethics, but it will explain it away” (661).
Without objective value or meaning, ethics cannot prescribe objectively correct or objectively right behavior. Instead, ethics are limited to prescribing subjectively ethical behavior. In other words, the ethicist can argue that “X is good, therefore do Y,” but this argument is implicitly based on the philosopher’s subjective assumption about what is good. Because it lacks any defensible claim to objectivity, the ethical admonition is the philosopher’s attempt to compel a subject to act according to the philosopher’s own subjective assumptions about right and wrong; that is, it is an exercise in the philosopher’s will to power.","Brian F.

Thus, Darwinism cannot justify the existence of normative terms that name intrinsic values and categorical obligations. For example, group selection can lead to altruistic behavior (Trivers 1971) and it can even lead us to laud altruistic behavior because it is in our own adaptive self-interest, but it has no means to impart altruism with objective good. As Sommers and Rosenberg argue, “If all apparently purposive processes, states, events, and conditions are in reality the operation of a purely mechanical substrate-neutral algorithm, then as far as explanatory tasks go, the only values we need to attribute to biological systems are instrumental ones. An evolutionary account of moral belief will not only explain ethics, but it will explain it away” (661).
Without objective value or meaning, ethics cannot prescribe objectively correct or objectively right behavior. Instead, ethics are limited to prescribing subjectively ethical behavior. In other words, the ethicist can argue that “X is good, therefore do Y,” but this argument is implicitly based on the philosopher’s subjective assumption about what is good. Because it lacks any defensible claim to objectivity, the ethical admonition is the philosopher’s attempt to compel a subject to act according to the philosopher’s own subjective assumptions about right and wrong; that is, it is an exercise in the philosopher’s will to power.","Brian F.

Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto III, 9

Some 700 years ago, Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) wrote an epic poem about a man’s journey through the afterworlds of hell, purgatory, and heaven. In his Divine Comedy, he cataloged the vices and virtues of people who had passed into those spiritual domains, providing valuable insights for the living. Dante describes hell as a very unhappy and inhospitable place with nine different levels, ranging from the blazing inferno of the eternally damned to the rather benign First Circle, reserved for worthy individuals who were born before the world was redeemed and therefore could not enter the gates of heaven (Alighieri, 1947).
Within this general metaphor, this chapter will take the reader on an educational journey through the various levels of scientific misconduct, from unintentional but questionable research practices, such as citation bias, to serious scientific fraud, such as the fabrication of data. Our purpose is not to instill fear but to illustrate the consequences of scientific misconduct so that we can learn how to avoid them. Table 14.1 shows the seven types of misconduct explored in this chapter. In addition to describing these various ""sins"" and the people who commit them, we also discuss their relative seriousness, the punishments that can result, and how to prevent these kinds of problems before they arise. 

The first issue is carelessness, exemplified by unconscious or conscious citation bias, misrepresenting the accomplishments or findings of others, and neglecting to reference findings that an informed reader would need to interpret the author’s conclusions. In its most benign form, this problem consists of a failure to read and understand the articles one cites. A more serious offense is the distortion of others’ work so that their ideas or findings support a preconceived point of view that the author is trying to advance. Carelessness can also be manifested in poor management or inaccurate presentation of data. The second ethical issue is dual and redundant publication, which occurs when two or more articles share any of the same data without full cross-referencing. The third issue is unfair or irresponsible authorship. According to standard Ethical Practice Guidelines published by the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE) and similar guidelines of other organizations (e.g., Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), all persons named as authors must meet certain criteria.
Failure to declare a conflict of interest (COI) is the fourth ethical issue considered in this chapter. A COI is a situation or relationship in which professional, personal, or financial considerations could be seen by a fair-minded person as potentially in conflict with the researcher’s or author’s independence of judgment. The fifth ethical violation is the failure to conform to minimum standards of protection for animal subjects or human research participants. The latter includes confidentiality of patient records and other data, informed consent, and proper explanation of the risks of research participation. Abiding by standards set by national and institutional boards for the protection of animal or human subjects is an important aspect of research under this rubric. 
Plagiarism is the sixth issue. Plagiarism literally means the act of “literary theft” by using or closely imitating the language and thoughts of another author as if they were one’s own. The final level is scientific fraud. This form of misconduct consists of the deliberate fabrication of data or the alteration of findings to make a study more credible and acceptable for publication. 
A meta-analysis of survey studies conducted by research scientists and their student trainees across various disciplines indicates that up to 33.7% admit to engaging in questionable research practices, and 0.3%–4.9% have fabricated or falsified data. Misconduct is reported more frequently by medical and pharmacological researchers than those from other disciplines. How prevalent are these various ethical problems among addiction scientists? ISAJE conducted an informal survey of its members to learn about the kinds of ethical misbehavior most concerning to journal editors. Duplicate publication and inappropriate citations were the most common problems encountered by journal editors in their routine processing of manuscripts. A substantial number of journals had experienced more serious forms of scientific misconduct, such as plagiarism and failure to declare conflicts of interest (COI). Authorship problems were also noted quite often. Although most problems were considered infrequent occurrences by the editors, it is likely that these issues are often hidden from the eyes of busy editors and reviewers. For example, editors and reviewers are unlikely to detect scientific fraud in the normal editorial process because data fabrication can be easily hidden in lab records and computer files that are inaccessible during the review process. Skilled reviewers are more likely to detect plagiarism and citation bias, but there is a general suspicion that the cases of identified and provable misconduct are just the tip of the iceberg.","Babor, Thomas F., Thomas McGovern, and Katherine Robaina. “Dante’s Inferno: Seven Deadly Sins in Scientific Publishing and How to Avoid Them.” In Publishing Addiction Science: A Guide for the Perplexed, edited by Thomas F.
