"Socrates emerged at a critical moment in Athenian society. The Sophistic teachings had led to a confusion of thought, a corruption of morals and skepticism. Selfishness and self-conceit were everywhere prevalent. Men claimed to know everything, when in reality they knew nothing. An atmosphere entirely foreign to the earlier days of the Athenians hung over the city. The citizens were unable to receive justice at the courts. Wealth, luxury, indifference, immorality, atheism and selfishness had resulted in bringing chaos to Greek life. A crisis faced the people. Who would arouse the citizens from their lethargy?
With Socrates a new era begins in philosophy. He knew his knowledge was limited and he knew how far to proceed and that made him the great man of his age. His influence and power over men was striking. His command was, ""Follow me and thou shalt learn."" Thus, as Socrates taught and questioned all with whom he came in contact, he started to get at the basic principle of all knowledge. He worked with concrete examples and, although many of them were crude and simple, nevertheless they served his purpose.
He studied the soul and strove for the improvement of man's moral nature. His method was entirely introspective. Xenophon tells us that he endeavored to have his pupils distinguish between ""what was pious; what impious; what honorable; what base; what just; what unjust; what wisdom; what folly; what courage; what cowardice."" Consequently, in order to have the Athenian mind grasp his idea of goodness he clearly states and shows how much one is dependent upon the other. There is a relation between man and man, which, if the best is to be obtained, cannot be broken. While his views on goodness, virtue and happiness are utilitarian in their conception, nevertheless, Socrates endeavored to instill in the minds of the citizens the thought that they must work individually and collectively to realize the ideal that he placed before them.
It must be admitted that Socrates' method of teaching and philosophizing excited many of the Athenians' hatred against him. The truths he taught made him very unpopular with the so-called philosophers of the day. He laid bare the superficiality of their systems. Many of them charged high rates of tuition for their instruction. Socrates was glad to impart his noble truths gratuitously to all who would come to him. The result was that he had a large following of disciples from all classes among the Athenians.
However, his personal enemies in order to avenge themselves upon him brought two charges against him: He was an atheist with respect to the gods of the city and he was guilty of introducing a new deity; and he was also guilty in corrupting the minds of the Athenian youth. His accusers condemned him to death. In making his defense, his arguments were irrefutable. His enemies had not proved him guilty. Socrates, out of the fullness of his heart, forgave the Athenians for their injustice. It is true Socrates had his faults; but who has not? Socrates lived the virtuous truths he taught. He was willing to die for the truth in order that the truth might live.",socrates,"Heathcote, Charles W. “Socrates.” Social Science 3, no. 4 (1928): 447–51. http://www.jstor.org/stable/23902315.",Socrates,Socrates,"In the modern era you have to spend like 4 years working on a PhD to make a very narrow academic argument.

Therefore, presenting a theory before examining specific cases would be the opposite of his approach and something he would be least likely to do.

"Cities are changing in shape and spreading out rather than retaining the compact nature that previously characterized many urban settlements in Europe. An analysis of urban sprawl in Rome from 1949 to 2006 revealed interesting patterns of urban change. Rome grew from a compact city in the 1940s to one with urban sprawl by 2006. Urban sprawl is generally a negative phenomenon that creates a number of environmental, spatial, social and economic problems. The concept of the compact city emerged as a reaction to the great increase in sprawling suburbs after the Second World War. This is one reason why the compact city is one of the most important topics on the international environmental agenda.
The literature on the psychological aspects of compact cities can be analyzed from many perspectives. Urban space has a social character because it is produced in a collective process; the social perception is a result of a subjective point of view. Properly organized space in cities (and corresponding urban systems) must foster social inclusion, prevent social exclusion, and promote identification and interaction between people. The living area and all the elements needed for survival (e.g., buildings, infrastructure and landscape) must be treated as a group of experimental behavioral phenomena manifested in the personal relationship between people and place (i.e., the sense of place). This unique relationship has been named topophilia by Yi-Fu Tuan. People perceive space and decide whether it meets their requirements regarding compactness.
The word urban comes from Latin urbanus 'belonging to a town'. Urban areas are built by people and contrast with surrounding areas. According to various definitions, a compact city is a spatial urban structure characterized by compact urban areas with urban agglomeration. The physical (urban or functional) structure of a compact city interacts with psychological aspects; namely, the social perception of a compact city. A city can be compact from the urban point of view, but its social perception may be totally different.
Research in the city of Toruń demonstrates this principle. From the point of view of the grid network analysis, Toruń is quite compact. Urban areas are located in the core zone, and less urbanized or non-urbanized areas surround the urban areas, creating a green belt that seamlessly connects the suburban natural areas, ensuring the preservation of natural habitats. However, from a social perception standpoint, residents do not generally perceive Toruń as very compact. While the city's public spaces are well organized and distances are short, respondents identify significant limitations in sustainable activities and energy management that affect their perception of the city's compactness.
This disconnect between physical structure and social perception reveals a crucial insight: a compact city has not only physical and functional dimensions but also psychological ones, created by its users' perception of space. A city may be technically compact in its urban planning while failing to create a sense of compactness for its residents.",compact_cities,"Adapted from Rogatka, K. & Ramos Ribeiro, R. R. (2015).

"The literature on the psychological aspects of Black female identity can be analyzed from many perspectives. Since Black women's forced migration to the Western world, their bodies have been legally and socially constructed as ""differently gendered"" and as sexualized sites of public property. In the aftermath of slavery and during the Jim Crow era, Black women challenged the dominant discourse on Black womanhood by reimagining the Black female body as a space worthy of public scrutiny in various ways. For Black women today, most public criticism relates to sexual behavior and dress, as exemplified by figures like Dr. Cosby who argued in his ""Pound Cake Speech"" that all would be well in poor Black communities if women would simply be more ""respectable.""
The relationship between respectability politics and appearance stems from the controlling images identified by Patricia Hill Collins - the Mammy, Jezebel, and Sapphire stereotypes. Although early Baptist women's groups used respectability politics as part of a broader strategy for racial uplift and civil rights, today's version lacks this activist dimension. Modern proponents rely almost exclusively on the idea that appropriate Black behavior alone is the key to Black success, while critics argue that acquiescing to respectability politics represents an assimilationist adoption of white supremacist thinking.
What is missing from current conversations around respectability politics is how early iterations of these ideas by Negro women and Black temperance organizations were tied to activism - they did not merely admonish and blame the poor. Poor Black mothers today are instead blamed for their attempts to mitigate difficult circumstances, whether through low-wage labor or illegal work like sex work. Their needs and concerns as decision-makers for their children are often ignored by schools and institutions.
The generational divide among Black feminists continues because respectability politics has become for many the primary framework for resistance. While younger artists like Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj incorporate feminist elements, their feminism is mediated through respectability politics. Their acts of self-expression may seem liberating but are often only resistive within the Black community, as there are no standards of respectability governing Black women's sexualized performances for mass consumption. While a white woman's sexual transgressiveness may challenge paradigms of female purity, a sexualized Black female body does not destabilize dominant narratives—it reinforces them.
Those who rail against respectability politics often fail to access a nuanced intersectional perspective regarding Black women's bodies as capitalist products. The focus remains stuck on dismantling respectability as the primary vehicle for activism, rather than addressing deeper structural inequities. What is needed is a more complex understanding of how race, class, gender and capitalism intersect in the lived experiences of Black women navigating social institutions and cultural expectations.",black_female_identity_politics,"Adapted from Ali, K.

"From where do we look upon the world and from where do we understand what we see? These questions demand we interrogate how geography, socio-economic position, race, and gender shape knowledge production. The idea of 'centring the margins' emerges from decolonizing debates, where Western academia constitutes an imperial core that sets the boundaries of legitimate knowledge, marking itself as knowledge creator while relegating non-Western voices to mere subjects of study. Reorienting our understanding of where knowledge comes from is essential to addressing the lingering effects of colonialism in determining what knowledge counts and who is deemed knowledgeable.
This geographical reorientation must be accompanied by recognition of epistemological differences that affect what knowledge is produced. Feminist geographers have long argued that all knowledge is situated, requiring continuous reflexivity to understand how the researcher's position influences what is known and conveyed. In development research particularly, where power differentials between researcher and researched are pronounced, such reflection reveals how accounts of people and places are invariably partial. These concerns extend beyond methodology into the politics of representation - who speaks for whom, what actually gets heard, and in what historical context?
Decolonial scholarship illuminates how dominant narratives can become defining stories that obscure deeper truths. For instance, characterizing London simply as a ""wealthy, global multicultural city"" masks profound structural inequalities along racial and ethnic lines while hiding how imperial legacies perpetuate these disparities. Centring marginalized voices is therefore not just about adding different perspectives but about political transformation led by those typically treated as research subjects rather than knowledge producers.
As bell hooks writes, ""To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the main body."" Her work shows how even ostensibly progressive theories can work against marginalized groups' interests when they fail to truly listen to and incorporate marginalized perspectives. The solution is not merely for mainstream researchers to adjust their methods, but to fundamentally reconsider how they listen and to whom. For voices from the margins have always spoken and theorized their experiences - they have simply been systematically ignored by those at the center.
This is not to suggest that marginal positions automatically confer pure or privileged insight. Rather, the work of hooks and others acknowledges the intellectual labor required for marginalized people to capture and theorize their lived realities. Through methods like counter-narrative and alternative visual representation, marginalized groups can both represent themselves and produce new frameworks for understanding. The goal is not just to add different voices to existing conversations, but to transform how knowledge itself is conceptualized and validated.
The challenge for readers and researchers is to practice genuine reflexivity - to constantly question our own position as knowledge consumers and our role in maintaining or disrupting established centers and margins. Only through such critical self-awareness can we begin to reorient knowledge production toward a more equitable and inclusive paradigm.",centering_the_margin,"Adapted from Patel, K. (2020).

"The parallel between black humor and existentialism begins with the same fundamental assumption - that the world is absurd. Long before existentialist philosophy emerged, African American humor recognized and responded to the inherent absurdity in the rules governing slavery and Jim Crow society. This absurdity invited numerous jokes that highlighted the irrational nature of racial oppression, as when a slave caught killing his master's pig cleverly rationalized: ""Yes, suh, Massa, you got less pig now but you sho' got more nigger.” Here, the principle of ownership is turned against itself through wit, exposing its underlying contradictions.
The absurdist strain continues in stories like that of a white deacon who finds a Black man in his church and demands to know what he's doing there. When told the man is there to mop the floors, the deacon responds, ""Well, that's all right then...but don't let me catch you prayin'."" The punch line reveals volumes about the hypocrisy inherent in Jim Crow religious practice. Such humor serves multiple functions - as a safety valve for releasing tension, as a means of minimizing pain and defeat, and as an artful medium for expressing grievance and grief.
While much African American humor developed as a coping mechanism, it would be reductive to view it only through this lens. Black humor is also a rich source of creative energy that allows for the strategic exposure of societal contradictions. Under the violent restrictions of slavery and segregation, African Americans developed sophisticated forms of tendentious jokes that often left whites ""with the baffled general feeling that [they had] been lampooned [before their very eyes] without quite knowing how."" This ability to craft layered meanings that could pass safely in mixed company while carrying subversive messages for those who could decode them became a hallmark of the tradition.
The complex dynamics at play are evident in the career trajectories of early Black comedic performers like Bert Williams and George Walker, who became successful by performing what were known as ""coon"" roles - stereotypical caricatures demanded by white audiences. While these performers tried to work beyond the constraints of racist expectations, they remained bound by them. Yet Black audiences of the era often found humor in popular stereotypes of themselves when presented in certain contexts, suggesting that the relationship between performer, audience, and racial representation was far from simple. This raises challenging questions about whether whites and blacks could ever truly be laughing at the same thing or whether, as some argue, white laughter at Black comedy inevitably reinforced notions of racial superiority.
The enduring power of Black humor lies not just in its ability to help people endure oppression, but in its capacity to expose the fundamental irrationality of racism itself. Through clever inversions, subtle ironies, and strategic ambiguity, Black humor continues to serve as both a shield and a sword - protecting while it critiques, entertaining while it educates, and finding ways to laugh at a social order that remains, in many ways, as absurd as ever.",black_humor,"Adapted from: Early, G., Carpio, G., & Sollors, W.

"In my opinion, the ethical concerns surrounding animal consumption can only be given the consideration they deserve by the adoption of qualified moral veganism. My commitment to veganism is qualified as my theory does not demand that human beings abstain from eating animal products in all situations. It is a moral, rather than a dietary, position that can be adopted by everyone, even by those who ought not to adopt vegan diets for justifiable personal, social, or ecological reasons: in a similar way to how even those who might justifiably resort to consuming human bodies in emergency situations may agree with the view that it would not be appropriate to do so in more ideal situations, my claim is that even those who might justifiably eat animal products in some situations ought nevertheless to refrain from doing so (with the exception of consuming human milk and—in very specific circumstances—honey) in more ideal situations. It is a vegan theory in the sense that vegan diets ought to be the default diets for the majority of the human population.
Many people's diets increase negative global health impacts (GHIs) by neglecting our duties towards the nonhuman world. Though we must give moral consideration to how our actions affect both animals and plants, I argue that animals, and particularly those who are most closely related to human beings, should be granted greater moral significance. In this light, some vegan diets can, in some situations, impose greater negative GHIs upon other animals than other diets. However, in many situations, this does not undermine the validity of a vegan diet as some diets that impose relatively greater GHIs upon other animals may produce fewer negative GHIs overall due to their smaller negative GHIs upon moral agents' interests in holistic health.
The duty that many people have to adopt a vegan diet does not stem merely from our prima facie duty to avoid actions that inflict pain, suffering, and death upon animals, but also from the prima facie positive GHI of accepting a taboo on the consumption of animals, regardless of whether the animals in question have been killed for food. This is also why I questioned research that aims to create animals with reduced sentience and research into synthetic flesh.
I emphasize that I do not argue for a universal duty to adopt veganism. Veganism is not a nonnegotiable moral baseline. Imagine a population living on a remote island with very poor soil conditions. If it were impossible for the people in question to obtain sufficient quantities of fruits and vegetables without tilling the soil, they could either feed themselves by digging over a lot of land, killing lots of animals in the process, or they could dig over a much smaller area and use some of the mussels who happened to live on the shore.",moral_veganism,"Adapted from Jan Deckers, ""Animal (De)liberation: Should the Consumption of Animal Products Be Banned?""

"After abolishing the one-party state of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) and pushing forward the process of democratization in 2000, Mexico experienced an unforeseeable rise of organized crime that resulted in unseen levels of horrific violence against civil society and the state and between the criminal cartels fighting for dominance to control drug trafficking routes. Several historical developments and geographical prerequisites also led to the surge in criminality that Mexico is experiencing at present. 
Firstly, Mexico's geographical location predestines the country as a drug-trafficking route, since nearly every legal or illegal transfer of goods from South America to the United States (USA) goes through Mexico. During the Nixon-initiated War on Drugs, the United States managed to block the Caribbean smuggling routes that were frequently used by Colombian drug trafficking organizations (DTO) in the 1980s, which led to the relocation of their trafficking routes through Mexico and then resulted in the tremendous growth of Mexican DTOs. Secondly, also geographically determined, Mexico is split by two massive mountain ranges that reach from the country's north to its south and make it difficult to implement policies and enforce the rule of law in many rural areas. This has contributed to inefficient public services, widespread poverty, drug abuse, and social and political exclusion in these areas. As people in these regions felt abandoned and saw impunity for crimes due to non-existing or corrupt law enforcement agencies, it is not surprising that such regions as Michoacán are some of the areas that are most affected by criminal cartels today.
Cartels already existed before Mexico transitioned to a multi-party system. The PRI-government, military, and law enforcement were undoubtedly pervaded by corruption, which led to illicit arrangements between state officials and mainly the Sinaloa cartel, but also to a relatively peaceful coexistence between organized crime syndicates and the government. These arrangements were dissolved as the PRI was removed from government in 2000. Since then, criminal cartels have competed for domination of smuggling routes through Mexico, but also diversified their criminal activities to arms trading, human trafficking, kidnapping, and extortion. As organized crime got out of control and increased steadily, the then newly elected President Felipe Calderón declared in 2006 that his government would fight the cartels with military force. During his eight-year presidency, the cartels resisted this military approach with success. The battle led to circa 83,000 casualties between 2006 and 2012. As the violence increased even further after Calderón's military approach, most studies on the topic, as well as most Mexican journalists, concluded that these offensives led to more violence as the cartels extended their military capacities during this period and committed even more acts of exaggerated brutality in public spaces.

"Machine guns, though now common in navies and armies, face a strange problem in their adoption. While basic versions called ""organ guns"" existed back in the 1300s, today's versions like the Gatling and Nordenfelt guns are completely different from these early weapons. Two main things drove their rapid development: better manufacturing methods, especially for rifle-sized guns, and the new threat from torpedo boats that could harm even the strongest warships. These torpedo boats, being fast and hard to spot, made traditional ship weapons nearly useless for defense, creating an urgent need for new solutions.
But military leaders, especially those in artillery units, have fought hard against using these new weapons. They mainly oppose them because of an unreasonable fear that machine guns would make traditional field artillery obsolete. This resistance has really slowed down the adoption of rifle-sized machine guns, with critics always bringing up how French mitrailleuses failed fourteen years ago as proof against using them. But this argument ignores all the major improvements made since then, suggesting the real problem isn't the technology but rather military leaders' unwillingness to change. The resistance is particularly puzzling given the clear advantages these weapons offer in modern warfare.
The improvements in machine gun technology have been remarkable. The old Gatling ten-barrel gun weighed 450 pounds and could fire about 500 shots per minute. Compare this to new models like the Nordenfelt and improved Gatling guns, which weigh only 230 pounds but can fire 1,000 shots per minute. Even more impressive, the Nordenfelt five-barrel gun, weighing just 128 pounds, shoots faster than the original Gatling. These advances show that technical complaints about machine guns don't make sense anymore. The weight reduction alone represents a massive improvement in mobility and practical battlefield use, yet critics continue to focus on decades-old problems that no longer exist.
Thus, supporters of machine guns stopped trying to present them as replacements for field guns. Instead, they began showing how machine guns could work alongside existing weapons, giving infantry and cavalry concentrated firepower in a mobile package. These new guns weren't meant to replace artillery but to add firepower where needed without weakening other positions. This new way of thinking finally started breaking down the resistance, with famous military leaders like General Skobeleff and Lord Wolseley becoming strong supporters. The shift in perspective was crucial - by positioning machine guns as complementary rather than competitive weapons, advocates finally found a way to overcome institutional opposition.
This story shows a pattern we often see with military innovations, where resistance to change hides behind outdated technical objections. The development of machine guns teaches us that successful military innovation needs more than just good technology - it needs careful handling of institutional politics and relationships. As armies and navies slowly accept these weapons, we can see that the biggest barrier to military progress isn't technical problems but institutional stubbornness. The machine gun story teaches an important lesson: revolutionary military technologies succeed not just because they work well, but because their supporters learn to work within existing military structures and beliefs. This pattern continues to repeat itself today with modern military innovations, suggesting that understanding institutional resistance is just as crucial as understanding technology itself.",machine_guns,"Adapted from Sleeman, C.

"In the early seventeenth century William Harvey established that there is continuity between arteries and veins, and that the heart pumps blood through these vessels in a circular fashion. Harvey developed his hypothesis by observation of the relatively slowly beating hearts of cold blooded animals, such as snakes, rather than those of warm-blooded animals, which beat too fast to detect the pattern of their motion.
Today, a patient's heart and lungs can be temporarily supplanted by a mechanical pump and oxygenator. The heart can be stopped for many hours, opened and subjected to intricate surgery, such as the replacement of a heart valve with a manufactured prosthesis or with animal tissue. At the end of the operation the repaired heart and the lungs are re-plumbed into the circulation where they resume their normal function. This technique of open heart surgery involves opening the chest and the catheterisation of the great veins carrying the blood returning to the heart from the system. This deoxygenated, venous blood is collected in a reservoir, then passed through an oxygenator. The freshly oxygenated blood is pumped back into the arterial circulation through a convenient artery.
The heart is rendered quiescent and kept viable by cooling and by perfusion of the coronary arteries with a ""cardioplegic"" solution, which prevents the heart beating and also supplies the heart with requisite nutrients and electrolytes. The artificial heart-lung circuit is filled with blood of the same group or with a synthetic priming solution, and clotting is prevented within this extracorporeal circuit by the use of heparin. Under these conditions the heart can be operated on for many hours. Even long and delicate procedures such as the replacement of a heart valve can be performed at a leisurely pace.
The first use of cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient was by Gibbon in 1953. However, Gibbon had started experimental work on the technique 19 years previously. In 1930 one of his patients died because of obstruction of the pulmonary artery with a massive embolus. This naturally provoked the thought that the blockage could have been successfully removed, and her life preserved, if even a portion of the patient's circulation could have been taken over by an extracorporeal heart and lungs.
It was 4 years before Gibbon and his wife had the opportunity to test this technique in the Surgical Research Laboratories. They found that it was possible to take over part of the pulmonary circulation of the cat by an artificial, extracorporeal circuit for four hours, with the cardiorespiratory function being adequately maintained. During these early experiments on cats, Gibbon tested various types of pump and oxygenator. It was established that a pulsatile flow (such as occurs with the heart) was not essential for the proper functioning of the perfused organs. The oxygenator originally used by Gibbon was a rapidly moving hollow cylinder constantly gassed with a 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide mixture.
There was a hiatus in research from 1939-1945. Gibbon and others then began extensive experiments in dogs to perfect a technique whereby complicated and time-consuming operations could be performed inside the chambers of the heart, without the problems associated with complete occlusion of the vessels carrying blood back to the heart.",cardiopulmonary_bypass,"Adapted from Botting, J.

"Nations throughout history have expressed their thoughts and feelings through material objects, recording their cultural essence in stone, wood, metal, and cloth. These artifacts reveal not just technical skill but quality - the essential element that transforms mere objects into art. Quality, rather than medium or category, determines whether something achieves artistic merit. The quality that elevated the Parthenon or Gothic cathedrals into art is the same quality that can make modern advertising artistic.
This artistic quality requires two fundamental elements: fitness for purpose and aesthetic beauty. A product must be suited for its intended use while also providing pleasure to the aesthetic sense. Too often, people mistakenly equate art solely with painting or sculpture, failing to recognize that art is a quality that can manifest in any medium when these dual criteria are met.
In the realm of advertising, this understanding becomes particularly crucial. Advertising represents the most immediate form of communication between producer and consumer in our commercial age. For advertising to succeed, it must achieve four essential qualities: it must capture attention effortlessly, maintain that attention through genuine interest, convince viewers of the product's merit, and ultimately entice them to purchase. However, many advertisers mistake mere visual chaos for attention-grabbing design, cramming advertisements with every possible color, shape, and ornament.
This approach reflects a broader misunderstanding about artistic representation. For fifty years, Americans have labored under the belief that pictorial elements are necessary in every artistic object. While pictures represent the height of fine art expression, their misuse in inappropriate contexts - from wallpaper to carpets to advertising - creates aesthetic discord. The mere presence of pictures does not ensure beauty; rather, it is the quality of consistency that determines artistic merit.
Similarly problematic is the indiscriminate use of ornament. Many believe that decoration alone creates art, leading to the thoughtless application of ornamental elements divorced from their historical and cultural context. The same Louis XV decorative motifs appear incongruously in advertisements for everything from Bibles to machine factories. This reveals a fundamental ignorance about ornament's meaning and appropriate use.
The solution to these artistic shortcomings must begin with education. Public schools provide the foundation for developing artistic understanding in a democratic society. By teaching children to recognize quality in color and form, to understand that over-ornamentation often expresses vulgarity rather than sophistication, and to respect historical periods for their cultural significance rather than mere decorative elements, we can establish a basis for genuine artistic progress.
Museums too must evolve beyond being mere repositories of pictures where people passively admire beauty. They should become active centers of learning where people study every phase of human artistic development across all materials. Current museum practices often overwhelm visitors with undigested artistic content, like forcing a child to swallow an enormous piece of meat whole. What's needed is careful organization and direction to help people understand and appreciate art systematically.
The path to improving advertising art ultimately requires addressing these broader cultural issues. We must recognize that we live in a social, industrial age where practical concerns must harmonize with aesthetic ones. Through public education, museums, and art institutions, we must cultivate understanding of artistic principles rather than emotional gratification. Only by thinking in terms of both fitness and beauty can we elevate the artistic quality of all human endeavors, including advertising.",art_advertising,"Adapted from Alvah, Frank.

While U.S. officials claim dramatic reductions in civilian casualties despite increased strike frequency, critics - especially within Pakistan - maintain that drones primarily kill innocent civilians. This controversy reflects deeper questions about the evolution of modern warfare technology and its human costs.
Recent claims by U.S. officials suggest a remarkable improvement in targeting precision. Government representatives assert that between 2008 and 2010, civilian casualties dropped sharply even as the number of strikes more than doubled. Some officials have gone further, claiming periods of up to a year without any civilian deaths. However, these assertions have met with skepticism from human rights organizations and Pakistani observers, who argue that the lack of independent verification makes such claims dubious.
Examining independent databases tracking drone strikes reveals a more nuanced picture. Three separate tracking systems, though utilizing different methodologies, show a clear trend: civilian casualties decreased significantly from 2009 to 2010, even as strike frequency intensified. The New America Foundation's data shows civilian deaths dropping from 163 to 40 despite strikes increasing from 53 to 118. Similar patterns appear in other databases, with civilian casualties falling to between 1.5% and 5% of total deaths in 2010, down from much higher percentages in previous years.
Several factors appear to explain this increased precision. The CIA has reportedly enhanced its intelligence networks in Pakistan's tribal regions, providing more accurate targeting information. New technology, including smaller ""Scorpion"" missiles and improved surveillance capabilities, allows for more precise strikes with reduced collateral damage. Additionally, stricter authorization procedures and a more cautious approach to strikes when civilians might be present suggest a systematic effort to minimize unintended casualties.
However, the data also reveals limitations to these improvements. All three databases contradict claims of zero civilian casualties over extended periods, documenting multiple incidents with civilian deaths during timeframes when officials claimed perfect precision. Moreover, civilian casualty rates began creeping upward again in 2011, suggesting that the dramatic improvements of 2010 may have reached their practical limits.
The implications of these findings extend beyond simple statistics. While the data supports claims of improved precision, it also highlights an inherent tension in modern warfare: the drive for technological solutions to minimize civilian casualties occurs within a context where some civilian deaths remain virtually inevitable. This raises profound questions about how societies should evaluate military actions where civilian casualties can be reduced but not eliminated.
The Pakistani public's response further complicates this picture. Despite evidence of improved precision, surveys show that approximately 67% of Pakistanis oppose drone strikes. This suggests a disconnect between technical improvements in precision and public acceptance of drone warfare. The gap may partly reflect the covert nature of the program - with the U.S. government unable to publicly defend or explain its actions, narrative control often falls to critics and targets of the strikes.
This dynamic creates a paradox: even as drone technology achieves unprecedented accuracy in targeting, public opposition may be growing rather than diminishing. The evolution of drone warfare thus demonstrates both the possibilities and limitations of technological solutions to complex military and political challenges. While engineering can reduce civilian casualties, it cannot necessarily resolve the deeper questions about sovereignty, accountability, and the human costs of remote warfare that drone strikes continue to raise.",drone_strikes,"Plaw, Avery, Matthew S.

"The purpose of this article is to further the understanding of the nature and function of dwarves in Old Icelandic belief by an investigation of the names applied to them. These names are scattered through the Fornaldarsögur, the Younger Edda and in various Eddic poems. Most of the names are in two versified lists; the shorter list in stanzas 10 to 16 of the Völuspá, the longer, called Dverga heiti, among the nafnaþulur. These two lists, which are derived from a common source, have a large number of names in common; the Völuspá has nine or ten that are not in the þulur, and the latter have a somewhat larger number which are not in the Völuspá.
The Icelandic þulir, the men who composed versified jingles, were skilled technicians in verse, and would have been ridiculous in their own eyes and before the public had they resorted to nonsense words to fulfill the requirements of their difficult metrical scheme. Moreover, the þulur were only secondarily a metrical tour-de-force; primarily they were a thesaurus of poetic diction arranged by subject matter. So the conditions under which these lists were composed lead us to expect dwarf-names that were readily intelligible to contemporary Icelanders and that described the dwarves in accordance with popular belief.
The investigation of the form of dwarf-names made it evident that they were a contemporary product, based on current conventional accounts of dwarf-activities. If there had been no conventionalized pictures of the nature, manner of life and functions of dwarves upon which the coiners of dwarf-names could base their creations it would not have been possible for us to group the names about a small number of definite ideas.
Many of the dwarf-names describe the Living Dead. The dwarf is called Nár, 'corpse,' Náinn, 'like a corpse,' Dáinn, Dáni, 'like one dead,' Búinn, 'prepared (for burial).' The dead man is Bumburr, 'a swollen thing;' as decomposition progresses he becomes Brúni, 'dark brown,' Bláinn, 'black.' No longer a proud upstanding man, he is Barri, 'awkward, butterfingers,' Dulinn, 'weak and slow.'
Dwarves with a local habitation are described in terms of the place where the corpse lies buried; Aurvargr, 'gravel-outlaw' i.e. 'the outlaw buried in the gravel,' Hlevargr, 'lee-outlaw,' i.e. 'the outlaw buried in the sheltered spot,' Þjóðreyrir, 'buried in the great stone-heap.'
The fact that, with the exceptions which have been already noted, no ancient heroic names were applied to the dwarves—no old compounds which linguistic changes had fused into a unit separable only by trained scholars—shows that the naming of dwarves was not an ancient custom.
