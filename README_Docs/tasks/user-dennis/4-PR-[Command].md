# PR Diff Analysis Workflow

## Step 1: Generate the diff
Run the following command to write the diff to 4-PR-Diff.txt:

```bash
# Generate detailed diff against main
git diff --full-index main -- > README_Docs/tasks/user-dennis/4-PR-Diff.txt
```

## Step 2: Analyze the diff
Carefully examine 4-PR-Diff.txt to identify all changes between your branch and main:
- Review file additions, deletions, and modifications
- Understand functional changes vs. cosmetic changes

## Step 3: Document your analysis
Write a detailed analysis of your findings in 4-PR-Notes.md, including:
- Summary of key changes
- Potential impact areas
- Recommendations for the PR review
- Any questions that need to be addressed before merging
