# Global UI Navigation Tracking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track user navigation centrally to provide contextual awareness to Kalypso and ensure consistent UI state across the application.

**Key Files:**
- `store/slices/uiSlice.ts`: Enhanced with navigation tracking capabilities
- `store/selectors.ts`: Added selectors for accessing navigation state
- `components/RouteTracker.tsx`: Updated to handle navigation tracking
- `app/(dashboard)/(routes)/home/page.tsx`: Integrated with new navigation system

**Implementation:**
- Navigation state is now stored in a central location with:
  - Current page/route 
  - Sub-section details (for nested navigation)
  - Context data specific to the current page
- New hooks and selectors for components to access and update navigation
- Better logging and debugging capabilities

# Performance Optimizations

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond to my actions without delays.

**Key Files:**
- `components/RouteTracker.tsx`: Added caching for study plan data
- `app/api/study-plan/route.ts`: Enhanced with better logging
- `app/api/user-info/route.ts`: Improved error handling

**Implementation:**
- Local caching of API responses to reduce redundant calls
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Improved error handling with detailed logs
- Better loading states and fallbacks

# Introduction Video Feature

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be introduced to the platform with a helpful video that explains key features, and not see it again once I've watched it.

**Key Files:**
- `components/home/IntroVideoPlayer.tsx`: New component for displaying intro video
- `prisma/migrations/20230815123456_add_hasSeenIntroVideo.sql`: Database schema update
- `app/(dashboard)/(routes)/home/page.tsx`: Logic to show/hide intro video

**Implementation:**
- First-time users see an introduction video in place of the ChatContainer
- Video includes controls and accessibility features
- Confirmation button appears after watching
- User preference is stored in database to prevent showing again

# Elevenlabs Integration (Planned)

**User Story:** As a user, I want Kalypso to have a more realistic and engaging voice when speaking to me.

**Implementation:**
- Plans to integrate ElevenLabs for more natural Kalypso voice interactions
- Mentioned in tasks but implementation pending
