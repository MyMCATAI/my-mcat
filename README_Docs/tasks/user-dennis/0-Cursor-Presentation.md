## MD Documents
- use markdown files always
-"Create a detailed markdown checklist of unchecked, one-story point tasks for the feature."
-reference file names for each file change that needs to happen

- see file structure of folder `user-dennis`
- context - debug and consoles help immensely.

- Important because once you have it in markdown you can re-analyze each checklist against the codebase - do this especially for long list of code changes.
